<PRE>Hi Ravindra,

 

&gt;<i>From the tracefile I do not see any remarkable difference. Maybe you
</I>VoIPphone made the call from a different port than registerd?

BTW: I do not see any packets inside of OpenIMScore. Where did you trace?

 

I suggest you produce a tracefile again showing registration and session
setup in one tracefile (including core nodes).

Subject: Re: [OpenIMSCore-Users] 400 Bad request- not following indicated
service routes

 

Dear Franz Edler,

As i understood clearly from the analysis of trace files and from my
researching ,is that there is a problem in 'service-route header'. which is
reached upto my VoIP phone in the 200(OK) message from the S-CSCF in the
registration process (find the attachment below).

After that when i tried to establish a communication session(Call) between
two clients, this 'Service-route header' field is not including as the
content of Route header of SIP request message from the client (but it
should be pre-loaded in the SIP request message so that the registrar will
provide services from a proxy or set of proxies associated with that
registrar). Please find the attachment below.

With this condition when i tried to call from my VoIP phone i was getting an
error like '400 Bad request- not following indicated service routes'. so for
this as you suggested i changed the pcscf.cfg to enforce the service routes.
After this, now i am getting an new error like '403 forbidden- not
registered! you must register first with a S-CSCF.

By suspecting NAT problem, i even disabled NAT in pcscf.cfg as like below
line, Even though i am working in independent intranet infrastructure: 
modparam(&quot;pcscf&quot;,&quot;NAT_enable&quot;,0)  // (changed the value 1 to 0)

So what may be reason for this issue and how can i solve it ? And is there
any scope to manipulate this 'service-route header' field? so it can reach
upto P-CSCF in SIP request message, while making call/message.

PS: But by using Soft clients(Eye-beam), i could able to make calls and
everything is working fine. 

Please find the tracefile(tcpdump based) attachments.  

I hope you could help me.

 




Thank you and Best regards,

This I clearly a feature of the client.
In case of Eybeam you have activated the Voicemail button. Therefore it
immediately after successful registration it tries to check the mailbox,
which is not successful, as S-CSCF is not a mailbox.
You can deactivate that.
The VoIP phone does not have such a feature.

BTW: True IMS clients also send a SUBSCRIBE request after successful
registration but not for mailbox checking but rather for the registration
event. But that is another story.
 For more details check some IMS tutorials.
