<PRE>any port which is different from the ports port_us and port_uc.

The number of the ports port_us and port_uc are communicated to the
P-CSCF during the security mode set-up procedure, cf. clause 7.2. These
ports are used with both, UDP and TCP
&lt;/snip&gt;

There is a similar requirement for the P-CSCF.

Additionally, the ports declared in the Via and Contact in the 1
REGISTER and 2 REGISTER messages will very likely be different.

When the UE initially registers (i.e. no security associations exist)
the first REGISTER message will contain

a)	in the Via header - the IP Address and Port number that the UE
is expecting the P-SCSF to send it's (401) response (the port number
will be an unprotected port)
b)	in the Contact header - the IP address that the UE would expect
future Requests to be sent to. A port number IS NOT required, but if it
is included it should be set to the same port as described in a) above.

In the Second REGISTER message (in response to the P-CSCFs challenge to
the first REGISTER)  will contain

c)	in the Via Header - the IP Address and Port number that the UE
is expecting the P-SCSF to send it's response (the port number will be
the UEs protected Server port port_us, assuming UDP is used)
d)	in the Contact header - the IP address that UE would expect
future Requests to be sent to. A port number IS required (by 3GPP
standards) and will be the UEs protected Server port port_us, for the
UDP case) This is specified in  TS 24.229 para 5.1.1.2. d)

&lt;snip&gt;
a Contact header set to include SIP URI(s) containing the IP address of
the UE in the hostport parameter or FQDN. ............If the REGISTER
request is protected by a security association, the UE shall also
include the protected server port value in the hostport parameter;
&lt;/snip&gt;

So in conclusion;

The Security associations used by the UE and P-CSCF should use the ports
defined in the Security Client and Security Server headers and NOT
Contacts or Vias. The contact and vias in the protected 2nd REGISTER
will reflect this. The unprotected and protected REGISTER messages WILL
come from different ports.

The UE and P-CSCF MUST used different ports for protected and
unprotected messages as defined in TS 33.203.

When the P-CSCF receives the 401 challenge from the S-CSCF it should set
up temporary security associations (based on Sec server/sec client). The
P-CSCF should expect the 2 REGISTER message to arrive (protected) at its
protected Server port from the UEs Protected Client port.=20

The 200OK from S-CSCF to the P-CSCF should be used to convert the
temporary SAs to new SAs (update the SA expiry).

Your BUG fix when implemented should support the above operation and not
force the UE to use the same ports for protected and unprotected
messages. The P-CSCF should use different ports for protected and
unprotected messages.

 Hello Soshant,
=20
 I think that the SAs are always created, just that it is not used if
the
 2nd contact is different.
=20
 Well, you shouldn't change the contact between the 2 messages - the 2nd
 REGISTER should basically be a resend of the first with the extra
 authorization information.
=20
 Anyway, the fact that this might happen means that it might be a
 security issue.  So the way it works is that on the 401 just one SA is
 set, for receiving the next 401. This is because the client might  not
 know the secret anyway and this might just be a DoS attach. The other 3
 SAs are set just before the 200 OK is sent.
=20
 In your case, the problem is that the IPSec info is saved on the first
 REGISTER and then re-used on the 2nd to set the SAs, but those were
 wrong and as such not used. So we need to actually update the IPSec
info
 based on the info in the 200 OK, which is the info to trust as the
 REGISTER was authenticated.
=20
 I have filled a bug report here: <A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/node/115">http://www.openimscore.org/node/115</A>
=20
 But in any case, I would recommend that you do not change the Contact
 during the registration.
=20
 Cheers,

 &gt; We are trying to register a UE with OpenIMS using IPSec/AKA. On
 &gt; receiving the 401 challenge from pcscf, the UE sends second Register
 &gt; to pcscf that is encrypted using ipsec. This register is decrypted
 &gt; fine by the pcscf. However the pcscf does not encrypt the 200ok it
 &gt; sends back to the UE. The 200 ok is sent in plain text to the UE. We
 &gt; checked and found out that the pcscf does not create a security
 &gt; association in the direction from pcscf to the UE. It only creates
 &gt; security association in the direction from the UE to the pcscf. The
 &gt; attached trace, trace1.pcap shows this.
 &gt;
 &gt; We changed the contact field in the first register to match the
 &gt; contact field in the second register and in this case the security
 &gt; associations are created fine in both directions. This is shown in
 &gt; trace2.pcap that is attached.
 &gt;
 &gt; Is this expected behavior? What is the reasoning for making the pcscf
 &gt; match the contact field of the two register messages before deciding
 &gt; whether or not to create a security association in the reverse
direction?
