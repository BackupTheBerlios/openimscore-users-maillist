<PRE>Hi Usman,

&gt;<i> I have problem with 2 user registration via UCT IMS Client during testing
</I>PCRF
&gt;<i> &amp; PCEF.
</I>&gt;<i> I have installed PCRF module completely. First, i register alice ... it
</I>works Ok.
&gt;<i> But when try to register bob (2 user), somehow i am not able to register.[
</I>&gt;<i> Error: 17:13:05&gt; Registration Failure (for REGISTER) ] I have also check
</I>on the
&gt;<i> s-cscf terminal window but didn't find any clue
</I>
&gt;<i> I have also attached the wireshark screenshot.
</I>
The screenshot does not help. You have to look into the details of the
signaling sequence (create a trace protocol with &quot; tcpdump -i any -s 3000 -w
/var/tmp/trace.pcap&quot;).
If you need help post the trace-protocol.

&gt;<i> 1. What is the exact difference between pcscf.cfg and pcscf.qos.cfg files
</I>&gt;<i> because when i use the simple pcscf.sh file, I am able to register as many
</I>&gt;<i> users as i have in HSS ?
</I>
You have to analyze the difference. There is no other way around.
If you post both files I might help if I find time in the next days.

&gt;<i> 2. When i can see Diameter message on PCRF terminal ? (Although in the UCT
</I>&gt;<i> IMS client, I have set the QoS = &quot;Mandatory&quot; ?
</I>
Again the first step is to analyze the trace-protocol and the respective
log-file from the console.

&gt;<i> 3. Did I have to configure the openXcap, even though I have not created
</I>any
&gt;<i> policy. I am doing this QoS testing with alice &amp; bob I will be very
</I>thankful if
&gt;<i> somebody who is already running PCRF successfully on his machine can
</I>&gt;<i> answer. Specially this pcscf.cfg and pcscf.qos.cfg files
</I>
No. XCAP is a totally different story which has nothing to do with PCRF.
I remember I tried to setup the PCRF about 3 years ago with no success. I
analyzed the issues in more detail an recognized that the format of diameter
messages was not aligned anymore.
There was obviously an update of the protocol format on one side (I guess
OpenIMSCore) and the other side complained about unknown AVPs in the
message.
This has to be updated in the PCRF solution of UCT.
