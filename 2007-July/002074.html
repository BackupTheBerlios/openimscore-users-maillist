<PRE>Hi Kevin,

If the openser acting as a presence server is installed on localhost and 
listening on port 5065 (as specified in the openser cfg file) then what is 
happening is this:
(anyone reading this correct me if I am wrong)

- Your HSS has a Trigger Point configured to capture SIP requests which 
have a method SUBSCRIBE or PUBLISH.
- This is associated with the presence server (default_as) through an 
Initial Filter Criteria, which is basically associating both together.
- The IFC is then associated with a service profile (to which users are 
associated). You can have more than one IFC in a service profile, and this 
are ordered by priority.

1. When the IMS core sees a SUBSCRIBE from the UA for a particular contact 
this matches the trigger point and thus triggers the AS associated with 
it, which in our case is the presence server (openser).
2. Once openser receives this it stores the request in its database (its 
not the database being used by OpenIMScore, its openser's database), which 
corresponds to the tables I mentioned earlier.
3. When the IMS core sees a PUBLISH from the UA, the openser presence 
agent checks if there were other clients which SUBSCRIBEd to the UAs URI 
and if yes, it sends a NOTIFY to them to inform them that the UA has 
changed its status.

I am not sure but I think the NOTIFY also should happen after the 
SUBSCRIBE, if the database is already storing any status information for 
the URI the UA is interested in.

Hope this clarifies your difficulties a little bit.

regards,
Josef

[OpenIMSCore-Users] PUBLISH, how to modify files and which files to 
forward PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE method to Presence server?






Thanks Josef, but i still don't understand how the IMSCore forwards 
PUBLISH method to the application server(presence server) added which uses 
&quot;localhost:5065&quot; as the AP address. And, what do you mean about entries in 
the watchers and active_watchers tables? I also can't find them.
