<PRE>Hi all,

What is the best way to configure the HSS triggering points to avoid that 
the SIP requests sent by a B2BUA application are not looped in back to the 
application again?

A quick hack would be to add some header to the request going out of the 
application and setting the trigger point to exclude any requests which 
have this header. 
Is this the right way to do it, or is there some better way to avoid that 
requests from the application are looped back into it, causing an endless 
loop? (maybe using via routes, or maybe detecting that the request is 
originating from a UA?) 

thanks,

Josef
