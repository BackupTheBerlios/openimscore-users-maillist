<PRE>Hi Kevin,

Did you check your openser database? You will probably find entries in the 
watchers and active_watchers tables.

[OpenIMSCore-Users] PUBLISH, how to modify files and which files to 
forward PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE method to Presence server?






<A HREF="http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/presence_server_howto.html">http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/presence_server_howto.html</A>
I add openser presence module on the IMSCore, and create an application 
server through web UI which named Openser_Presence and address is 
localhost:5065, etc. The presence server works well. 

Now the problem I am facing is about PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE routing. I got this 
error &quot;busy everywhere&quot; when i test PUBLISH without modify anything. How 
can I modify the files and which files to forward those methods to the 
presence server? Please give more details, thank you!

One more thing, when i subsribe to the IMSCore, i can get a basic notify 
response with status, contact, uri,and etc information. But i cannot find 
any new record in any databases. Where does these data save in?
