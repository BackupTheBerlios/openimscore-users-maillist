<PRE>Sougata,

 

yes, that's clear.

If you have configured your network interface (eth0) the get ist parameters
via DHCP, then you always will get a DNS-entry of the public DNS server into
the resolv.conf.

The only way to avoid this ist o configure your network interface (eth0)
with static parameters and use the public DNS server via a forwarding
mechanism in in DNS.

 

As an example I attach the network configuration file
(/etcnetwork/interfaces) and the /etc/bind/named.conf.options wher you can
see the forwarding mechinsm.

Hi Franz , 

I tried to comment that first DNS server and surprisingly my users are
getting registered.

That means, suddenly and surprisingly the P-CSCF was sending the DNS query
to my university DNS (193.145.56.11) instead of sending to the DNS installed
at own pc (10.80.4.244) and it wasn't getting resolved. 

But then, how it could distinguish till 2 days ago? 
As i have an idea , this resolv.conf should also contain the DNS address via
which i am accessing any webpage in the open internet.

I would also like mentiond that everyday when i start my PC and checking
this resolv.conf file , it shows me namserver ip as the university DNS
193.145.56.11 and then i have to add this my own DNS address along with the
generated domain name which is open-ims.sougata. I was doing like this way
till 2 days ago.

Regards , 

Sougata

So you can see that two different address for DNS servers are available.

What is when p-cscf used the first for the query?

In this case you should avoid to have two different addresses when only one
ist he correct one.

 

This may happen when you have DHCP based address assignement on your
machine. This automatically overwrites /etc/resolv.conf.

You better should use a static configuration.

 

BTW: All the assumptions (guesses) can easily be verified if you look into a
tracefile and check where the P-CSCF sends the DNS query which cannot be
resolved.

HI Franz , 

I am checking all those files again and again , starting from resolv.conf to
named.conf , named.conf.local , named.conf.options , open-ims.dnszone

My resolv.conf looks like this - 

nameserver 193.145.56.11
nameserver 10.80.4.244
search open-ims.sougata
domain open-ims.sougata

As my P-CSCF is working on my own pc, having IP address 10.80.4.244 , so i
have updated the resolv.conf file with the required details along with the
created zone name. This file was just the same till 2 days ago untill when
everything was perfect.

Earlier when i registered my users for the first time , this error got
generated but suddenly it solved on its own and i didn't have to do anything
but now this time it has started again and i am really at wits end why this
error suddenly getting generated.

REgards ,

Not an easy question tob e answered from remote.

I propose you should first check the DNS address the P-CSCF use
(/etc/resolv.conf)

Hi Franz , 

Yeah i have also got confirmed that it is a DNS error.
The P-CSCF when quering the DNS, it cant match the open-ims.sougata domain
name and the query is not moving forward and generating error 478 and error
500.
How to fix this sudden generated error? 

Regards, 

Sougata

So, as I guessed it is a DNS problem. Look e.g. at packets 442-450.

Hi Franz , 

Sending you the attached tracefile which i took just now.
I am also guessing that it maybe some DNS error as it came before also but
it got solved on its own. Suddenly it has started again. 
Everywhere my own DNS server which is installed in my own pc having IP
address 10.80.4.244 has been declared. 

Has anyone faced this kind of sudden error 478 or error 500, when your IMS
is running perfectly fine till to the day before?? 

Regards ,

That's most probably a DNS issue.
Most probably your P-CSCF now uses another DNS server - assumption to be
verified only with a trace protocol attached.
