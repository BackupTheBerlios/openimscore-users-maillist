<PRE>So, the discussion goes around the fact that although the CSCFs are SIP 
proxies, there are some exceptions when they act as B2BUA and perform 
session tear-down. However, I don't think that this subset is enough for 
a complete &quot;call-control&quot;.

I agree with Franz that we should not taint the CSCFs with such 
functionality, as from an architectural point of view, the call control 
for charging is an AS task and not a core network one. We can go through 
a long discussion and argument why this is not a good idea. Most 
important thing from my point of view would be that we would no longer 
keep the core network light and easily scalable. To make an analogy 
between CSCFs as signalling routers and Routers for IP traffic, you 
would not implement charging directly in the IP router, because you want 
to keep it fast - adding user based state to it would really kill it.

Then there is a 2nd potential side of the discussion: using ser_ims not 
as a CSCF, but as an AS. This is always possible, yet please keep in 
mind that B2BUA, and AS implementations overall, are mostly out of scope 
in SER. There where long discussions with the main developers and I also 
agree with them that this is out of scope.

Than being said, it is still possible, just harder. There are B2BUA 
modules in SER and you could build such functionality. We did it in the 
P/S-CSCF partly to handle session termination, yet, it is just some 
hacked stuff so it would be relatively hard I would say to build a full 
B2BUA handling calls. If you just want to work like a proxy and 
terminate the call when you like, then there is no big trouble, just 
reuse what we did; but if you would like to also control media and stuff 
you will have to add code.

Cheers,
-Dragos
