<PRE>hi,

as Franz already told you in general SER is only a proxy server


There is only one small exception, because the 3GPP specification 
requires that the P-CSCF and S-CSCF not only act as a SIP proxy but also 
as a SIP UA  for some cases (for example the release of a call for 
administrative reasons) we did implement this functionality and its 
called release_call included in the P-CSCF and S-CSCF with several cases 
being contemplated.
This function is used for appropriate signaling upon dialog expiration 
and upon policy when using the PCC extensions included in the 
cdp_sessions branch.

 &gt;Is it that we cannot implement online charging in SER_IMS as it is 
based on SER?

You can implement the online charging system, i guess you want to charge 
in the S-CSCF and spare programming the Ro interface (?) to an external 
OCS. It should be possible.

I do not know if this is the most advisable way to do it, or it would be 
better to use a external AS for the OCS that you have to consider.


 &gt;Or if we CAN, then do we have to have very tedious effort for doing it
through SER_IMS? Can you comment on the time-line, learning curve for doing
the same.

Programming for SER_IMS is not easy but also not very complicated, it 
requires a bit of time depending on your skills and on how familiar you 
are with C programming and SER modules structures.

Maybe doing some Java SIP Servlet is much quicker..


 &gt;and  also can some one let me know How to enforce call tear down when 
credit is exhausted in SER_IMS.

Take a look at the release_call files in the scscf or pcscf modules

good luck
