<PRE>Hello Unai,

first all: thanks for recognizing the stability of the core.

Your question is valid. What we always answer in this context is that
this is a warning and a necessary disclaimer as we promote the usage as
&quot;reference implementation for IMS technology testing and IMS application
prototyping for research purposes, typically performed in IMS
test-beds&quot;. If you'd like to use it commercially: do this on your own
risk. 

The reason is plain and simple the fact that many of the big vendors
have secured patents during the year-long standardisation and want to
see some ROI for this. (Now you can start the discussion on the
necessity of software patents but they are a fact.)

I invite you to do a quick search on specific topics on e.g. the Google
Patent Search (or any other patent DB). Example: issued US patent for
&quot;Accessing IP multimedia subsystem&quot; from Nokia granted 2007 for the US
(<A HREF="http://www.google.com/patents?id=qeqfAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=ip+multimedia">http://www.google.com/patents?id=qeqfAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=ip+multimedia</A>
+system&amp;as_psrg=1) and there's a ton more out there that you'd have to
stand up for / compensate (either with licensing money or
cross-licensing of own patents). 

If you would like to take on the effort to research such a patent list,
we'd welcome it but as we are only enabling testbeds in the R&amp;D domain
we so far did not have to deal with it.

Hope this answered your question.

Regards,

Peter
