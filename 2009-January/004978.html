<PRE>Hi Alberto/Franz,

Thanks for information.

Based on the mail exchanges so far, I am a bit confused though.

Scenario 1 ( as I perceive it):
SER_IMS is CAPABLE of call control as required by Online charging.
For this I just have to write proper code based on lines similar to
that of release_call() present in pcscf and/or scscf. Once I write
code for call control I dont need any support of any other AS acting
as B2BUA for charging.

Scenario 2 (as perceived by me):
SER_IMS (by itself) is NOT capable of call control as is mentioned in
SER guide and as is confirmed by senior members like Franz, Dragos.
And in order to implement Online Charging, I HAVE TO have a new AS
acting as b2bua for charging and call control.

My questions are:
Q1: Do I have both options for implementing online charging i.e.
option 1: IMS itself handles call control with help of functionality
similar to release_call.
option 2: With help of new charging AS (b2bua form) call control is implemented.

Q2: If I have both options, are there any differences w.r.t.
performance, capabilities, etc between the two options

Q3: (A bit redundant question) Why option of B2BUA was suggested in
place of &quot;actually modifying the IMS for call control&quot; (of course if
both options are similar)

Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i> as Franz already told you in general SER is only a proxy server
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is only one small exception, because the 3GPP specification requires

</I>&gt;<i>  for some cases (for example the release of a call for administrative

</I>&gt;<i> branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Is it that we cannot implement online charging in SER_IMS as it is based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SER?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can implement the online charging system, i guess you want to charge in
</I>&gt;<i> the S-CSCF and spare programming the Ro interface (?) to an external OCS. It
</I>&gt;<i> should be possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know if this is the most advisable way to do it, or it would be
</I>&gt;<i> better to use a external AS for the OCS that you have to consider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Or if we CAN, then do we have to have very tedious effort for doing it
</I>&gt;<i> through SER_IMS? Can you comment on the time-line, learning curve for doing
</I>&gt;<i> the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Programming for SER_IMS is not easy but also not very complicated, it
</I>&gt;<i> requires a bit of time depending on your skills and on how familiar you are
</I>&gt;<i> with C programming and SER modules structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe doing some Java SIP Servlet is much quicker..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>and  also can some one let me know How to enforce call tear down when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> credit is exhausted in SER_IMS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Take a look at the release_call files in the scscf or pcscf modules
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> good luck
