<PRE>Hi Dragos,

Thanks for the reply.

Sorry delay in replying, was away for some days.

Searched the lists for charging work going on. Got some information. You are
right, I meant the Rf/Ro interfaces.

Came to know about the purpose and intent of ser_ims from the website. Also,
saw the architecture to be flexible and pluggable enough for new features.
Regarding the compliance with the specifications: Well, non complying in
some percentage, doesnt that bias the testbed result or benchmarking results
in some way? Or if that is upto a &quot;tolerable&quot; limit, then is the compliance
tracked and documented somewhere? Like lets say I am trying to get some way
to figure out which areas contribute to the 10% non compliance, so that one
can get it near 100% compliant. Maybe a single documents lists out which
areas of a specification are left out or kept pending.

CHARGING TECHNICAL:
Went through charging and related specifications. Need to figure out how to
&quot;hook&quot; into message processing loop so that whenever a SIP message if
forwarded or was a reply, immediately after that some data extracted from
that message is used to construct an ACR. Some mechanisms needs to be in
place for the so that the correlation is possible between two ACRs. For
example during an voice call, when an an reply for an invite message is
getting forwarded an ACR which will icude ICID of the original INVITE
message. This ICID will remain constant till the end of call, when the reply
for BYE is sent, ACR with the same ICID is sent and at the Charging Data
Function (CDF), these two ACRs can be correlated with the help ICID. Can you
provide some pointers for this?

GENERIC QUESTION:
What are the prerequisites you think that the person should have in order to
understand the
1. ser_ims operation
2. understand design of ser_ims
3. restructure/redesign (if required) the ser_ims

Or in other words what roadmap do you suggest for somebody looking forward
to redesign or tweak ser_ims in term of adding new modules and/or tweaking
exiting core modules?

I have figured out this one, please add / delete / reorder this path
according to your thinking:
BASICS:
SIP basics
Diameter basics
Network basics
Advance network aspects like DNS, NAT, etc.
IMS SPECIFIC
IMS specifications (core modules)
Specifications related to other components in the IMS ecosystem (if
required)


Nice work up here, congrats.

Thanks,
Amit

&gt;<i> Hi Amit,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you are certainly not the first that wants to do this...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said several times before (search our archives for more details),
</I>&gt;<i> there are some things that I recommend:
</I>&gt;<i> - implement it as a separate module, so that it would be usable from any
</I>&gt;<i> CSCFs or anything else that you'd like to build on top of ser_ims.
</I>&gt;<i> - you'll need to do some debugging and finishes on the cdp module, in
</I>&gt;<i> the Accounting State Machine definitions. You can find those changes in
</I>&gt;<i> a branch of ser_ims.
</I>&gt;<i> - you probably are thinking about the Rf/Ro interfaces, right?
</I>&gt;<i> - there aren't any big roadblocks, other than time ;-) (if you have it,
</I>&gt;<i> you can do it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. See our statements on the website... experimentation, trials,
</I>&gt;<i> test-beds, validation, benchmarking, maybe as a reference, etc
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Of course. First of all, it has the nice configuration through
</I>&gt;<i> routing scripts. So the CSCF configuration files are just examples on
</I>&gt;<i> how to build something that does what the specs say for each functional
</I>&gt;<i> part. You are free to change that as you'd like, to extend it to new
</I>&gt;<i> specs or to make custom functions. If you need more advanced features,
</I>&gt;<i> you can take advantage of the modules - implement a new one for your
</I>&gt;<i> functionality and then use it from the routing script.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Mainly for the CSCFs 24.229. For the Diameter interfaces and the HSS
</I>&gt;<i> - 29.228, 29.229. Then there are a lot of RFCs. However, we don't keep a
</I>&gt;<i> list of them because we don't want to sell it, so to say, and we usually
</I>&gt;<i> do implement 90% of the standards in 10% of the time. So don't expect
</I>&gt;<i> full compliance for everyting, but just the most useful features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> -Dragos
