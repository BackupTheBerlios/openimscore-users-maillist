<PRE>Hello Amit,

well, in general it is very hard to make something 100% compliant to all
the standards required. Our approach was for 90% of the functionality in
10% of the time. We, as developers, would enjoy going for the extra
missing 10%, but the reality in most cases is that some features are so
seldom used, that one can not motivate the wasted time.

Then we can't either give you a list of the delta up to 100% compliance.
This is because it's quite a lot of work just to make an inventory of
every little thing that is not there yet. You see, open source software
is a hard business and we have to put our scarce resources in the places
where it would benefit the most first.

For things to do, see our tracker... I think that there are a lot of
outstanding feature requests and bugs to be solved in there.

Also, if you would be interested, I could share with you some
Interoperability tests results, which will show exactly what still needs
to be fixed. But even those tests are limited in scope and won't give
you everything.

Then yes, the benchmarking results are not comparable, but still, they
are valuable results. And if anyone complains, we would like to hear why
they are not good and then we will improve.

Charging:
- look in the routing scripts. You will see that there are different
routes for different requests.
- then try to understand a little bit how the P_save_dialog(),
P_update_dialog() and P_drop_dialog() function for example are
implemented in the P-CSCF
- try to implement similar functions, that would used what those saved
and add your additional functionality. Export these functions and reuse
them from any of the CSCF scripts.

Generic:
- C programming skills
- patience to look and learn from the code
- analyze the cscf modules for example. Each function is also
documented, so it shouldn't be too hard to understand it.

I am regularly guiding students into understanding and extending the
Open IMS Core and I have to warn you that it is not an easy task. There
are several types of bugs that even after years of experience with it,
are a headache to fix, even for me.

Your roadmap looks good! I would add some points on understanding SER's
architecture. Look also on www.iptel.org for documentation.
Unfortunately this is quite a big obstacle for beginners in our project.

In the end, in the name of the team, thanx for the kudos and tell us if
you would want to have write access or branches in the SVN. We would
like to enable a wiki-like style of coding and showing your changes to
the rest of the community would probably help you reach your goal sooner.

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the reply.

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry delay in replying, was away for some days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Searched the lists for charging work going on. Got some information.
</I>&gt;<i> You are right, I meant the Rf/Ro interfaces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Came to know about the purpose and intent of ser_ims from the website.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, saw the architecture to be flexible and pluggable enough for new
</I>&gt;<i> features. Regarding the compliance with the specifications: Well, non
</I>&gt;<i> complying in some percentage, doesnt that bias the testbed result or
</I>&gt;<i> benchmarking results in some way? Or if that is upto a &quot;tolerable&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> limit, then is the compliance tracked and documented somewhere? Like
</I>&gt;<i> lets say I am trying to get some way to figure out which areas
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to the 10% non compliance, so that one can get it near 100%
</I>&gt;<i> compliant. Maybe a single documents lists out which areas of a
</I>&gt;<i> specification are left out or kept pending.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CHARGING TECHNICAL:
</I>&gt;<i> Went through charging and related specifications. Need to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> how to &quot;hook&quot; into message processing loop so that whenever a SIP
</I>&gt;<i> message if forwarded or was a reply, immediately after that some data
</I>&gt;<i> extracted from that message is used to construct an ACR. Some
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms needs to be in place for the so that the correlation is
</I>&gt;<i> possible between two ACRs. For example during an voice call, when an
</I>&gt;<i> an reply for an invite message is getting forwarded an ACR which will
</I>&gt;<i> icude ICID of the original INVITE message. This ICID will remain
</I>&gt;<i> constant till the end of call, when the reply for BYE is sent, ACR
</I>&gt;<i> with the same ICID is sent and at the Charging Data Function (CDF),
</I>&gt;<i> these two ACRs can be correlated with the help ICID. Can you provide
</I>&gt;<i> some pointers for this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GENERIC QUESTION:
</I>&gt;<i> What are the prerequisites you think that the person should have in
</I>&gt;<i> order to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> 1. ser_ims operation
</I>&gt;<i> 2. understand design of ser_ims
</I>&gt;<i> 3. restructure/redesign (if required) the ser_ims
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or in other words what roadmap do you suggest for somebody looking
</I>&gt;<i> forward to redesign or tweak ser_ims in term of adding new modules
</I>&gt;<i> and/or tweaking exiting core modules?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have figured out this one, please add / delete / reorder this path
</I>&gt;<i> according to your thinking:
</I>&gt;<i> BASICS:
</I>&gt;<i> SIP basics
</I>&gt;<i> Diameter basics
</I>&gt;<i> Network basics
</I>&gt;<i> Advance network aspects like DNS, NAT, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> IMS SPECIFIC
</I>&gt;<i> IMS specifications (core modules)
</I>&gt;<i> Specifications related to other components in the IMS ecosystem (if
</I>&gt;<i> required)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice work up here, congrats.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Amit,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     you are certainly not the first that wants to do this...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As I said several times before (search our archives for more details),
</I>&gt;<i>     there are some things that I recommend:
</I>&gt;<i>     - implement it as a separate module, so that it would be usable
</I>&gt;<i>     from any
</I>&gt;<i>     CSCFs or anything else that you'd like to build on top of ser_ims.
</I>&gt;<i>     - you'll need to do some debugging and finishes on the cdp module, in
</I>&gt;<i>     the Accounting State Machine definitions. You can find those
</I>&gt;<i>     changes in
</I>&gt;<i>     a branch of ser_ims.
</I>&gt;<i>     - you probably are thinking about the Rf/Ro interfaces, right?
</I>&gt;<i>     - there aren't any big roadblocks, other than time ;-) (if you
</I>&gt;<i>     have it,
</I>&gt;<i>     you can do it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1. See our statements on the website... experimentation, trials,
</I>&gt;<i>     test-beds, validation, benchmarking, maybe as a reference, etc
</I>&gt;<i>     2. Of course. First of all, it has the nice configuration through
</I>&gt;<i>     routing scripts. So the CSCF configuration files are just examples on
</I>&gt;<i>     how to build something that does what the specs say for each
</I>&gt;<i>     functional
</I>&gt;<i>     part. You are free to change that as you'd like, to extend it to new
</I>&gt;<i>     specs or to make custom functions. If you need more advanced features,
</I>&gt;<i>     you can take advantage of the modules - implement a new one for your
</I>&gt;<i>     functionality and then use it from the routing script.
</I>&gt;<i>     3. Mainly for the CSCFs 24.229. For the Diameter interfaces and
</I>&gt;<i>     the HSS
</I>&gt;<i>     - 29.228, 29.229. Then there are a lot of RFCs. However, we don't
</I>&gt;<i>     keep a
</I>&gt;<i>     list of them because we don't want to sell it, so to say, and we
</I>&gt;<i>     usually
</I>&gt;<i>     do implement 90% of the standards in 10% of the time. So don't expect
</I>&gt;<i>     full compliance for everyting, but just the most useful features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheers,
