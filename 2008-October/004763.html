<PRE>Hi Raj,

I would rather just link those servers with a Diameter library. There
are many available out there, like the simple ones from our project
(JavaDiameterPeer, CDiameterPeer, for which non-GPL licenses are
available) or other complex ones like Open Diameter. Diameter has a lot
of features over RADIUS, so I don't think that the advantages are
questionable. Then Diameter has been around for a long time now - I
would call 5 years a long time in IT&amp;C - for this to still be an actual
scenario.

We also investigated around 2004 such bridges, but there are a lot of
inherent limitations, like not being able to push requests in both
directions. Without this, a Cx or Sh implementation will not be complete
(e.g. the RTR/A and PPR/A requests). This means that such 5 years old
RADIUS servers are just too old and need a architectural make-over anyway.

I doubt that the indicated gateway would solve issues like this...
unfortunately the article is just an ad and has no technical insight;
here are some parts:
- &quot;As a critical analyst, fragrance of perfect amalgamation of high-end
technology and user&#8217;s expectation provides ultimate pleasure and an
aesthetic user satisfaction.&quot; - this one made me look for what else the
author wrote on that site... oh dear...
- &quot;Lowering investment cost and simultaneously decreasing time to
revenue for the service provider.&quot; - pitching for those technically
challenged honchos... this is a temporary hack and I doubt that on the
long run such an intermediate transition is going to be cheaper than a
proper transition to NGN architectures.
- &quot;Users also find themselves in a position to access all new function
of NGN solution without substantial investment.&quot; - well, actually, not
&quot;all&quot; ...


In the end, getting back to your question: it probably makes sense in
certain scenarios, but for the Cx/Sh interfaces at least, I kind of
doubt it. You will have to take into account how the full new
functionality maps on the old one and whether this would work without
doing some big changes tot he RADIUS/LDAP side. Sure, such gateways are
easy to have, as you can see in Diameter the RADIUS inheritance and many
things are so easy to translate. But something is always lost, otherwise
one might argue that Diameter can't do more than RADIUS. And are the
benefits high enough to motivate the costs of an intermediate architecture?

just my 2 euro-cents,
