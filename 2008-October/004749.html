Dear Colleagues,

I have been trying to configure SIPp IMS Bench to send loads through 
the
Open IMS Core. But problems exist.

1. I used ims_bench.pl to set the manager, the instances as well as the
SUT. This process went well and no error poped up.

2. I then ran prepare.sh to deploy the instances. Necessary 
modification
was made to this script for it to run (Change the path to /sipp in the 
script). 3 files were able to be SSHed to a romote host as an SIPp 
instance. There was also no error.

3. I started the manager as instructed. No error.

4. I tried to start a SIPp instance on the remote host and I failed. 
The
error message was &quot;Unable to connect remote ctrl..., errno = 113 (No
route to host).&quot; on the remote host. I can not figure out how to solve
the problem at this time.

Another problem is how to configure SIPp instances in the Open IMS 
Core.
There would be a lot of instances so it's kinda impossible to configure
all of them manually.

The problem I listed here might be too specific... Help needed!!!

Thanks so much!!!!!!!

BR,
Jin
