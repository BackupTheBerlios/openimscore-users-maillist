<PRE>Hi Dragos

Thanks for the tips on this. Thanks for the info on the TRC. Just when you thought it was safe and you knew what all the IMS functions were, some smart alec goes and invents a new one :-)

Just for fun we should include SKOVIs in OSIMS (Some Kind Of Vague Interface) and may be have them standardized at ETSI/3GPP. SKOVIs have been found to be very useful in every system ever invented.

 Hi Mark,

 Well, we actually have it working and I can't think of any worth
 mentioning changes to the configuration files. In the past we had some
 Cisco Gateways and now we mainly use Cantata and Teles MGWs. Sometimes
 you'll want to add something like a SER MRFC in-between, if the MGW does
 not behave properly.

 For simple PSTN-to-IMS termination, you should route everything to the
 I-CSCF. Routing to S-CSCF is always bad, as maybe you have multiple ones
 and you don't know which one to choose.

 Then, a nice trick is to do PSTN &quot;origination&quot;. So if you'd want to have
 IMS services also applied for the originating PSTN users, you can
 trigger this by adding a Route: &lt;sip:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-users">orig at originating.users.domain</A>&gt;.
 Then just route this normally to the right I-CSCF, which will find a
 suitable originating S-CSCF and apply services there. Just be careful
 that the PSTN user will not be registered in the IMS sense, but
 unregistered. Also, obviously there's no P-CSCF involved in the
 originating part, so be carefull about security.

 As extra information, MSF actually standardized a TRC(F) function. The
 TRansit Controller would use ENUM to determine whether and where the
 originating and terminating users are to be serviced. I have changed the
 enum module in ser_ims to allow also for ENUM queries on the originating
 users (with the limitation that it does not fork the requests now if
 there are multiple options on the originating side, only takes the first
 one) - <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=579">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=579</A> .

 I am attaching an example trcf.cfg. If anyone finds it useful and
 actually working, then I will add this to the project's cscf.cfg examples.

 Cheers,
 -Dragos

 &gt;
 &gt;  Hello Mark,
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; I've seen a couple of posts in the archives that discuss this subject,
 &gt;  but
 &gt;  &gt; I didn't actually see anyone claiming to have a working solution. Has
 &gt;  &gt; someone actually managed to make a PSTN to IMS call (ref TS23.228
 section
 &gt;  &gt; 5.6.3) to a registered OSIMS core user?
 &gt;
 &gt;  No, sorry I did not. But I don't think it is a big deal, if one has a
 &gt;  gateway.
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; If so where does the MGCF send the invite - I-CSCF or S-CSCF?
 &gt;
 &gt;  To the I-CSCF as always on the terminating side, because the S-CSCF
 &gt;  responsible for the IMS user is not known to the MGCF.
 &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; Is there any special configuration in CSCFs or HSS to allow this call
 to
 &gt;  &gt; complete.
 &gt;
 &gt;  I don't think so. After a quick look into the scscf.cfg I assume, that
 an
 &gt;  incoming request from PSTN goes straight to the &quot;Terminating&quot; block.
 &gt;
 &gt;  Regards
 &gt;  Franz
