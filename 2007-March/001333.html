<PRE>Hello,
to me the linux live cd would be a great idea (although it's hard to believe so many people don't use Linux by default on laptops :-). I think VMWare is not necessary as it's just bloat.
Regards,
Claudio

Subject: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Proposal for OpenIMSCore-in-a-bottle
 
Hi all,

More and more people are asking me for a very simple way to run the
OpenIMSCore. It's not that the installation process is hard to follow,
as we had positive feedback of getting it going in something like 1/2
hour, but it's more about the required environment.

It seems that a lot of people are actually still not running Linux on
their portable devices by default ;-) and as such it is quite hard for
them to have demos on the road. Of course, there is the easy solution of
convincing them to dump their current operating systems, but let's take
the hard way and provide a live-cd with the OpenIMSCore pre-installed.

What I have in mind is to take an existing such CD image that you can
put in any laptop/pc and boot-up without having to do any preparation
steps like re-partitioning, formating, installing the OS, etc. On it, we
would have one of the latest revisions of the OpenIMSCore plus a set of
tools. I would start a list now and would appreciate your feedback on
what else you might want to see there:

- script to re-configure with your own domain name, IP addresses
- script to add new users
- script to backup the configuration + database to a USB stick
- script to update the core from SVN (the CD would probably have a long
life, unlike the revisions)
- script to backup the latest core to a USB stick

Also a lot of people are running now the OpenIMSCore from an
emulator/virtualization tool, like VMware. This could also be booted
there. Do you think that it would make sense also to have a VMware
virtual disk snapshot available?

Then, if you think it's a good idea and you could help us, we would
really need some help from people familiar with live-cds and how to
actually build them. As you probably noticed, we are quite busy now with
Rel.7 revamps and your help would be really appreciated.
