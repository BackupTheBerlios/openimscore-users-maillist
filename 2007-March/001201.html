<PRE>Hi Rajeswari,

 

please keep the mailing-list also on your e-mails. Sometimes there might be
someone else interested in your questions and sometimes I might be wrong in
my answer. So it helps us all.

 

Now to your questions:

@ 1):

To be precise: You have to assign the service profiles to IMS Public ID.

 

@ 2)

The I-CSCF might also come into picture (even if both parties are within the
same domain) if the location of the B-party is not known to the originating
S-CSCF. In this case the request might be forwarded also to a different
S-CSCF within the same domain. We have just only a small network: Bob and
Alice both have been assigned to the same S-CSCF during registration.
Therefore only one S-CSCF and I-SCSF is involved within a domain.

 

Cheers

Franz

Hi Franz,

 

Thanks for your previous replies.Iam using open-ims version 191

 

1. I am trying to add an Application server, such that the flow is
ue1-&gt;pcscf-&gt;scscf-&gt;hss(to look for default as)-&gt;scscf-&gt;pcscf-&gt;ue2.For this I
tried to define trigger points,    

then bind those trigger points to an initial Filter Criteria (iFC) and then
add the iFCs to a service profile.

 

 You said &gt;&gt; The service profiles then get assigned to IMS Public IDs.How
can I check this.

 

I tried in the above fashion but did not succeed ,can you please help where
to change the settings in cfg files for adding application sever.

 

 

2.In the present case the flow is from ue1-&gt;pcscf-&gt;scscf-&gt;scscf-&gt;pcscf-&gt;ue2.

 

 When invite is sent from alice to bob in the scscf the request is forwarded
to as per above flow.

  

  I f the ue2 is in other domain the icscf comes into picture with flow
ue1-&gt;pcscf-&gt;scscf-&gt;icscf-&gt;scscf-&gt;pcscf-&gt;ue2.

 

  Am I correct please correct me in this regard.

 

 

Looking forward for your help in the above case.

 

Many thanks in advance.
