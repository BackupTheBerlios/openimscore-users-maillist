<PRE>Hi Vladimir,

Could you please send me your new prepare.sh separately? There are 2
reasons that I ask for it:

1. Takes me too long to download the whole rar.
2. There's a legal thing as I am a FOKUS employee and for anything that
I release in this role (and I would hate to play a double game
FOKUS/private) the FOKUS legal fineprints must be followed. One of them
goes towards what the release actually contains. I have already assumed
a big responsibility by posting the first rar on openimscore.org as that
is 90% from you. Of course, I checked that once, updated myself a lot of
packages, but there's still the legal risk for me that a
backdoor/trojan/etc might be in there. I don't want to accuse you of
anything and please don't understand me wrong, I would put the whole
thing in SVN and give you full rw access to it if it would be feasible.
But I have to abide by the legal stuff on my side and play safe as
there's no full-proof chain of trust between you and me.

Because of this, it is impossible for me to directly post an update
myself. I would rather prefer to act as a maintenance proxy, add
incremental things and then release it. I know that this is really bad
from the development point of view as it just slows the process.... I
hope that we could maybe get to something like a script that generates
the whole vmware image from scratch, openimscore.org, gentoo.org, etc.
If this would be possible, we have the resources to automate this and
have weekly-builds for example.

Of course, you can and I encourage you to, keep posting new updates. If
you would like, I would change the openimscore.org/vm to also point
towards your list of releases.


Cheers,
-Dragos
