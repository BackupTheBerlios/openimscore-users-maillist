<PRE>Hi Vladimir,

&gt;<i> 1) OpenIMSCore image
</I>&gt;<i> * split startup script. Different script for each module
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I tried that but it was too complicated to manage. I think that I have
left the services in there, but not on by default. My idea was that if
you went to the pain of downloading the whole image, then you probably
don't want to tinker so intimately with it at the beginning, so a
ready-to-run config would be better. But in any case, I think that this
is a great thing, better than a live-cd as you can do your
customizations and keep them on.
&gt;<i> * assign different IP (192.168.101.*) address for each service. This
</I>&gt;<i> will allow to clone image and start every component on different image
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I was thinking towards 2 directions:
1. To have an interactive menu on startup where to first select your
interface of choice from the default ones, or either configure a new IP.
Then also configure a domain name. Then to automatically provision
everything in the core and start-it up. This will be executed just on
the first run or something and subsequent ones would be configurable
with an expiration timer or as a separate command. I hope to have
resources for doing this from next month (read ahead to see what I mean).

2. The image to call a mother-ship that will tell it what it should
suppose to be - a P, I, S, all, etc and in what configuration - IP,
domains, etc
&gt;<i> * Add script for create test users (<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-users">00000-99999 at open-ims.test</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I have those, I will put them on. It's a great idea for testing.


Then it's always the question of having even easier tools to just add
users... but then it's too easy and nobody would read any IMS books and
we'll be swamped in questions like &quot;What is an IMPI?&quot;...We already have
a GUI, which I think it's good enough if you understand the IMS
concepts, so I wouldn't go any deeper in this direction.
&gt;<i> 2) Image with KDE, UCT IMS Client, OpenIC_Lite, SIPp with different
</I>&gt;<i> scripts, Wireshark
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>OpenIC_Lite, you have seen is already there in text mode. UCT IMS
Client, SIPp, etc are not a bad idea at all.

Then I emerged KDE, Firefox - the result is that the final compressed
image is 600MB... I don't think that it's too much, but... what do you
think? What about adding eclipse and building an entire development
platform too.
&gt;<i> 3) Images with some application servers (presence)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>You mean different images? What about add-ons for the base image?
Unfortunately there has to be a limit on what we include, or else we'll
just try to do everything and nothing would work properly...
&gt;<i> 4) Image with IMS Bench
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Interesting... but I have concerns that you can achieve something good
for performance in a vm-ed environment.

But - we should definitely include multiple configurations: performance,
IPSec, IPv6, etc... this is going to be hard to maintain then...

The good news is that starting next month I have the &quot;go&quot; for assigning
one part-time student to work full-time on these issues.


&gt;<i> Maybe other...
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>


Cheers,
-Dragos
