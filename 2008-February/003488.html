<PRE>Hi Rakesh,

I will try to clarify.

&gt;<i> Thats not my question. We have already configured two clients which speaks
</I>&gt;<i> MSRP. But we need an AS to establish SIP session.
</I>
I understand that you want to include an MSRP relay into the session and
this inclusion should be triggered by an iFC. For normal setup of an MSRP
session between two clients you do not need an AS and an iFC. Right?

&gt;<i> I think (May be i am wrong) OpenIMS does not have an AS embeded in it. The
</I>&gt;<i> default port for AS given in OpenIMS configuration is 5065. But the
</I>&gt;<i> problem we are facing that whenever we are redirecting the INVITE request
</I>&gt;<i> to that port, error messages comes displaying that destination port is not
</I>&gt;<i> rechable.
</I>
You are right. OpenIMS does not have an AS embedded in it.
The default port for AS given in OpenIMS configuration is only an example.
This iFC cannot be used when you do not provide the AS at the address
indicated (the MSRP relay server in your case).

&gt;<i> Then we tried with some other AS. But again faced the same problem.
</I>
What did you try? Modifying the iFC or providing an AS?

&gt;<i> So I want to know whether any special configurations are required in
</I>&gt;<i> OpenIMS to establish the SIP session through some third party AS.
</I>
First: provide the AS
Second: use an iFC to route requests to the AS
The second point alone obviously results in &quot;destination not reachable&quot;.

&gt;<i> AS we are trying to establish MSRP session does anybody have any idea
</I>&gt;<i> about any AS that supports Messagaing and compatible with OpenIMS.
</I>
Sorry. No.
To be precise: you are looking for an MSRP relay server.


Regards
Franz
