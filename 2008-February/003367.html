<PRE>Hi all,

As the team in one of the many projects that uses the Open IMS Core
decided to waste a small amount of money on what runs at the base of
their developments, we are now finally able to take time and add IPv6
support to it.

1. The implementation of the first step has been completed - IPv6
support for the Diameter libraries.
    1.1 The JavaDiameterPeer seems to work just fine due to the hiding
of the network layer inside the JVM. There was actually not one line of
code changed
    1.2 The CDiameterPeer has been fixed and was tested in some basic
connectivity tests against the JavaDiameterPeer. Try SVN r525 or newer.
2. The CSCF support
    2.1 SER already supports IPv6. Here it's a matter of configuration
    2.2 Some of the CSCF modules probably won't as some of the
developers (mostly I) were too lazy to write an IPv6 parser when the
IPv4 one is so trivial; or IPv6 was simply not in scope for the first
prototype. In the next step I will try and figure all the points where
changes need to be performed.


So you can already start to use IPv6 on the Diameter interfaces and
feedback is of course mostly welcomed. Don't forget though to
reconfigure your C/JavaDiameterPeer xml configuration files - in the
Accept tag use:
    - no bind parameter to indicate a bind to all available interface,
IPv4 and IPv6 - I still get a warning that after binding on :: a bind on
0.0.0.0 is not possible, but it's no bug.
    - a bind=&quot;::&quot; to listen on all IPv6, similar to bind=&quot;0.0.0.0&quot; for IPv4
    - a bind=&quot;::1&quot; or whatever IPv6 address you want to use

Don't forget to update your DNS files! Else hss.open-ims.test for
example will still resolve in 127.0.0.1! For IPv6, instead of:

hss                     1D IN A         127.0.0.1

you should have:

hss                     1D IN AAAA      ::1

Oh, and of course, only try this on a IPv6-ready system...


For the SIP interfaces, it would probably fail for now. But watch this
thread for more announcements and also, if you can indicate failing
cases, it would help me a lot in the implementation.


Cheers,
-Dragos

P.S. We are very excited that finally we are going to support IPv6 and
we only wish that more of our users would realize that the Open Source
model works best when they contribute back, either with feedback,
financial resources or code. In this way more and more features could be
supported and the benefits to the users would only be higher...
