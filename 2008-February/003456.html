</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; 1) OpenIMSCore image

</I>&gt;<i>  I tried that but it was too complicated to manage. I think that I have
</I>&gt;<i>  left the services in there, but not on by default. My idea was that if
</I>&gt;<i>  you went to the pain of downloading the whole image, then you probably
</I>&gt;<i>  don't want to tinker so intimately with it at the beginning, so a
</I>&gt;<i>  ready-to-run config would be better. But in any case, I think that this
</I>&gt;<i>  is a great thing, better than a live-cd as you can do your
</I>&gt;<i>  customizations and keep them on.
</I>I write about /etc/init.d/openimscore. Just to split it to 4 different scripts
/etc/init.d/fhoss
/etc/init.d/pcscf
/etc/init.d/scscf
/etc/init.d/icscf
This will allow start only one service.
Or another solution - config file with list services to start.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * assign different IP (192.168.101.*) address for each service. This
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; will allow to clone image and start every component on different image
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  I was thinking towards 2 directions:
</I>&gt;<i>  1. To have an interactive menu on startup where to first select your
</I>&gt;<i>  interface of choice from the default ones, or either configure a new IP.
</I>&gt;<i>  Then also configure a domain name. Then to automatically provision
</I>&gt;<i>  everything in the core and start-it up. This will be executed just on
</I>&gt;<i>  the first run or something and subsequent ones would be configurable
</I>&gt;<i>  with an expiration timer or as a separate command. I hope to have
</I>&gt;<i>  resources for doing this from next month (read ahead to see what I mean).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. The image to call a mother-ship that will tell it what it should
</I>&gt;<i>  suppose to be - a P, I, S, all, etc and in what configuration - IP,
</I>&gt;<i>  domains, etc
</I>1) This config tool isn't easy task
2) Use of bultin DNS server not alwais possible. Usualli in corporate
environment we use only one DNS. And this DNS address is assigned via
DHCP. I can't easily add another DNS server to my Vista notebook :(.
To solve this problem I use testik.com domain. This domain is public
but use private ip for hosts. Another problem is routing and public
DNS not solve this problem :(

&gt;<i>  Then it's always the question of having even easier tools to just add
</I>&gt;<i>  users... but then it's too easy and nobody would read any IMS books and
</I>&gt;<i>  we'll be swamped in questions like &quot;What is an IMPI?&quot;...We already have
</I>&gt;<i>  a GUI, which I think it's good enough if you understand the IMS
</I>&gt;<i>  concepts, so I wouldn't go any deeper in this direction.
</I>FHOSS web console is better what some commercial IMS solutions.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Image with KDE, UCT IMS Client, OpenIC_Lite, SIPp with different
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; scripts, Wireshark
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  OpenIC_Lite, you have seen is already there in text mode. UCT IMS
</I>&gt;<i>  Client, SIPp, etc are not a bad idea at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Then I emerged KDE, Firefox - the result is that the final compressed
</I>&gt;<i>  image is 600MB... I don't think that it's too much, but... what do you
</I>&gt;<i>  think? What about adding eclipse and building an entire development
</I>&gt;<i>  platform too.
</I>
My KDE image will be around 400m. I not emerge KDE games and another
parts. eclipse is good idea but not all use eclipse. We use IDEA as
development IDE.
&gt;<i>  The good news is that starting next month I have the &quot;go&quot; for assigning
</I>&gt;<i>  one part-time student to work full-time on these issues.
</I>We also have dedicated CM (configuration Management) person in
company. He will create image with setup script. We start working on
development IMS services (call forwarding, conferencing, messaging,
etc). Developers and testers can't test services together on one big
IMS system (commercial). I want create separate image for every
developer with mysql, OpenIMS, some J2EE container like sailfin or bea
weblogic
