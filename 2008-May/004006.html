Hi, 

Thanks for the reply, Andreas.
I did try to add an IMPU for each of AS's and choose Distinct_PSI. The AS are added as well under Services as Application Servers with the same Server name as added IMPU's.
yet I do not see it working - another strange thing happens when I add the IMPU for the AS, I untick the option Can register, but as soon as I click save the value is automatically changed and ticked - ie that the IMPU can register, and in my case the application server doesn't need to register.
Is this correct what I am trying to set - have you had the same issue or .. ?

Thank you, 

BR, Persa

Hi, Depends on the event you want to subscribe to. Seems like youneed to provision Public Service Identities (PSI) to your services (e.g., sip:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-users">as1 at example.com</A> and sip:<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-users">as2 at example.com</A>). In case you haven&#8217;tdone this before it is almost the same as creating an IMPU, except you need to changethe &#8220;IMPU Type&#8221; to Distinct_PSI or Wildcarded_PSI (I think you needthe former in this scenario).

Subject: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Set SIP communication between twoApplication Servers Hi all, 
 
We have 2 Application servers connected to the same Open IMS domain ( AS1 andAS2).
We would like to send a SUBSCRIBE from AS1 to AS2 through the CSCF and then geta 200 OK answer back from AS2 to AS1 via CSCF.

When we send the message from AS1 to AS2 through the S-CSCF we get '404 Notfound - destination user not found on this S-CSCF'.
(We set the To-field to AS2 but we set a Route header to point to S-CSCF)
We have set up both App servers in the Open IMS on different ports and we havegiven them own filer criterias that are built on the To-header.

Note: When we send SUBSCRIBE from a user to the servers it works perfect. Themessage go througt to both of them depending on the To-header in the message.
 
 
What could be wrong?
1. Should we send the message through the S-CSCF if we want to communicatebetween 2 app servers in the same domain? Or should we go through I-CSCF?
2. Is there something that has to be set in some configuration file in thesystem, so the servers can find eachother?
3. Is the  Profile Part Indicator of the IFC attached to the ASinfluencing whether it should be registered or unregistered?
4. Each user profile has a service profile, which contains the respectiveifc/tp - how is the application server treated in this case, shouldthe application server have a service profile ?
 
Any suggestion or feedback on the matter is greatly appreciated, 
 
Thank you in advance,
 
Persa
