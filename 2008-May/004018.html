<PRE>Hi Persa,

Well, an AS is not a client and as such it works differently. It does 
not need to register for example.

The 404 is because AS2 is not an user probably. To send messages towards 
an AS, you will need to have an IFC that filters and forwards it there. 
The IFC is executed on an S-CSCF and the IFC is saved for the originator 
and/or terminator of the call, based on your service logic. For example 
an outgoing calls charging AS would trigger for the originator and a 
presence server accepting subscribes will trigger for the terminating 
side (or else how could Bob's service find Alice's charging server, or 
how could Alice's server know the presence server assigned to Bob?).

There's one more way of routing from an IMS Core to an AS. For example 
if you have one that would match everything for a certain identity, a 
better way to do it might be that you configure the AS URL as an &quot;S-CSCF 
location&quot; in the HSS for the PSI that you want redirected. Logically, 
the core would try through the I-CSCF to find the terminating side, the 
HSS would indicate that the S-CSCF that can handle it, but that is 
actually the AS URL and the message gets directly there from the I-CSCF.

To send messages from the AS (AS1-&gt;x), you will need to have first 
proper identification in the request (P-Asserted-Identity header!). Then 
you will need to decide whether you are originating or terminating the 
&quot;call&quot;. Originating means that you also want an S-CSCF for the 
originating side (AS1) to check services associated to AS1 (like I said 
before, charging). For terminating, you are only interested about 
services related to the terminating side. For originating you would need 
to add a Route: &lt;sip:domain.of.originaing.user;lr;orig&gt;. For 
terminating, no route is required.  Then route the message normally, 
like the SIP RFC says, to the first Route or to Request-URI if you have 
no Route. In both cases, the DNS would point to an I-CSCF that will find 
the right S-CSCF to continue processing the message.

I recommend that you read a book about IMS and service triggering to 
clarify all of this better.

Punctual answers:
1. no, in no case through the S-CSCF directly (except if you are already 
in a dialog and the dialog routes indicate so). There are multiple 
S-CSCFs in your networks and you can not decide which is the right one 
to use. The I-CSCF will find it for you.
2. no, but you probably want to add a IFC to trigger for the terminating 
side. AS do not register, so there's no such Contact in the registrar. 
The IFC triggering is the method of routing there.
3. The AS do not register. So the Profile Part Indicator of 
&quot;registered&quot;, when refering to an AS of course, does not make sense. 
They will be at most in the unregistered case. For clients, the 
difference between unregistered and not registered is that in the 
unregistered state, services could be applied (like a voicemail). This 
indicator is used to discriminate between filters that would be applied 
when the user is online and when he is not. Obviously, an IFC won't be 
downloaded from the HSS to an S-CSCF if it indicates that it only 
applies for the registered case, unless that identity does a registration.
4. not all application servers would need to be contained in a service 
profile. If you don't want messages to be filtered and sent to it then 
it does not need it. But an AS can appear as a PSI also (e.g. you want 
AS1 to also go through charging done by AS3, when calling AS2 for example)

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> Note: When we send SUBSCRIBE from a user to the servers it works

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> What could be wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Should we send the message through the S-CSCF if we want to 
</I>&gt;<i> communicate between 2 app servers in the same domain? Or should we go 
</I>&gt;<i> through I-CSCF?
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Is there something that has to be set in some configuration file in 
</I>&gt;<i> the system, so the servers can find eachother?
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Is the  Profile Part Indicator of the IFC attached to the AS 
</I>&gt;<i> influencing whether it should be registered or unregistered?
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Each user profile has a service profile, which contains the 
</I>&gt;<i> respective ifc/tp - how is the application server treated in this 
</I>&gt;<i> case, should the application server have a service profile ?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestion or feedback on the matter is greatly appreciated,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you in advance,
</I>&gt;<i>
