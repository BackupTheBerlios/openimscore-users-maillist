<PRE>Hi Dragos and all,

 

I'm having a problem related with the &quot;early&quot; CANCEL's. The scenario is the following  one :

A PSTN call to a SIP phone. The PSTN caller decides to cancel the call  a few moments right after initiating, so the PSTN will send the CANCEL message. When it arrives to the I-CSCF  this one is discarded and not forwarded to the S-CSCF. So what happens is that we have a ghost call.... The PSTN has already cancelled the call but the SIP phone continues to ring.

 

I have looked into SER lists and saw that there was a thread about  &quot;handling of early CANCELs&quot;. I have  contacted  Andrei ( from the SER development) about this problem and after analyzing the current scenario he answered:

 

&quot;The problem is when the CANCEL arrives the INVITE transaction has not received any reply yet (if you look in the dump you'll see an 100 trying
 from .9 long after the CANCEL is received). In ser in this case (CANCEL  received and no response yet on a branch)  the branch is dropped
 immediately. The CANCEL is also not forwarded downstream (the  rfc says that CANCEL should be sent only on replied branches).

So to make a long story short, upgrade to the latest cvs version and set  modparam(&quot;tm&quot;, &quot;cancel_b_method&quot;, 1). This will keep retransmitting
 the INVITE if no reply was received, even after the CANCEL arrives and  it will avoid all the above problems (see modules/tm/README |grep
 cancel_b_method for a more detailed description). If you still have problem, drop me another mail. I'm very interested if the cancel fix works properly, not only in my testbed. I'm starting to think that making this the default behavior might be a good idea (since it seems that it causes problems quite frequently). It might even become a  candidate for a backport to stable.

 

Andrei &quot; 

 

So now we are thinking about how we should proceed. We think that this issue (ghost call) is very important to be solved in Open IMS Core's. Do you think this issue is important enough to update the SER version to the latest?  Or  we should  create a special logic in the t_fwd.c in order to forward the CANCEL even if the provisional answer is not received (it is against the RFC but will solve the problem...)?

 

Any other ideas?

 

Thanks in any advance.

 

Regards, 

 

Nuno Ribeiro
