<PRE>NHi Roman,

&gt;<i> Yes, I know about IFC, but if we have 1 000 000 users and need
</I>&gt;<i> notfications about registation of particular 10 000 users, than it will
</I>&gt;<i> be a bad idea to handle REGISTER requests from all our users.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, imagine a following scenario: user A sends message to user
</I>&gt;<i> B while user B isn't registered. We can store this message and resend it
</I>&gt;<i> to user B when he/she will register. So we need to know somehow when
</I>&gt;<i> user B will send REGISTER request, but it has no sense to handle
</I>&gt;<i> REGISTER requests from all other users as it will cause extra load on
</I>&gt;<i> AS.
</I>
I understand. You need a dynamically activated iFC: activation of the 3rd
party registration trigger in case a message is in store for this user.

Maybe DSAI may applicable here. For your info in case you are not aware
about DSAI:

DSAI Dynamic Service Activation Information (C4-060624.doc)

The IMS service logic requires that SIP signalling for sessions
intialization transit trough the AS that implement the service whenever
the service is subscribed by the user and related iFCs are present in the
S-CSCF; this is true even if no action from a AS is required. This could
impact also delay and network element performance.
An optimization is proposed, that avoid useless triggering of ASs; it&#146;s
introduced the Dynamic Service Activation Info DSAI, as an indication
provided by Application Servers, of whether a subscribed service is active
or not. A service is active if the AS implementing its logic needs to be
involved during communication establishment: if it has no action to
perform when a communication is established, it is inactive. The
indication of DSAI can be used to &#147;mask&#148; or &#147;unmask&#148; Initial Filter
Criteria triggering to that Application Server: as such it allows to avoid
needless involvement of Application Servers. A key point of this mechanism
is that an Application Server can only enable or disable triggering of a
(set of) iFC, but it cannot change them since that would raise
unpredictable service interaction issues.

I am not 100% sure, but I think DSAI is already implemented in OpenIMSCore.

maybe that helps

Franz
