<PRE>Hi Peter and Dragos,

&gt;<i> we can see that a lot of guys have accessed the website and downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> the software but as we are currently compiling together a publication on
</I>&gt;<i> the subject, I was wondering WHAT your university or company is using
</I>&gt;<i> the software for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are especially interested in links to R&amp;D projects that make use of
</I>&gt;<i> the Open IMS Core. So if you would like to help us out and if you are ok
</I>&gt;<i> with finding that information in some paper sometime please reply to
</I>&gt;<i> this one (also in private if you like) with a link or brief
</I>&gt;<i> statement  ...
</I>
I am teaching SIP and IMS at the University of Applied Sciences in Vienna
(<A HREF="http://www.technikum-wien.at/">http://www.technikum-wien.at/</A>) as a lecturer. There I have lectures and
seminars and I am also tutor for bachelor and master theses.

My main job is at Alcatel-Lucent in Vienna in the area of IMS. But as there
is no IMS-development department in Vienna my job is more technical sales
oriented.

At the university I recommend to the students to use OpenIMSCore for
experimenting and to deepen knowledge on IMS. Unfortunately this does not
always happen as much as I expect.

Actually there are two master-theses ongoing using OSIMS as a platform.
These theses both deal with application development using SIP servlets.

In the last semester I had 
- a bachelor theses on integrating a presence server (OpenSER) into IMS
- a diploma thesis on developing the Rf interface for OSIMS (unfortunately
not finished)
- a master thesis on security algorithms (Ciphering Protocols and
Authentication Methods) in IMS

In the near future there will be
- a seminar work on PCC (investigation and evaluation)
- a seminar work on developing a trace-tool for SIP- and diameter flows
- some more students doing master theses on application development 

As a short summary: OpenIMSCore is a perfect platform to study IMS. Without
practical lessons it would be a rather dry theory. I whish I could get more
students willing to write some code as a contribution.

Thanks to the team at FOKUS!

Franz
