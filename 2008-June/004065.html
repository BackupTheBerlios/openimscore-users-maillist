<PRE>Hi Dragos,

Referring to the issue that we have exposed, we have created a patch that solved the issue (handling early calls). During the migration from the latest SER to ser_ims we have also solved other problem that we were trying to figure out a solution. The problem was that the CANCEL's and ACK's  messages were sent built based on the received INVITE and not on the INVITE sent, as it should be...  In respect with the thread: &quot;ISC triggering issue with Cancels&quot;. We think that this patche solve the Route header fields  in order to be handled correctly in CANCEL and ACK requests.

So this patche solves this 2 issues. This patche is composed by:
- diff from the our ser_im's &quot;tm module&quot; to the your tm folder release 564;
- diff from the configuration files; 
- two new files were added to support the new features: &quot;lw_parser.c&quot; and &quot;lw_parser.h&quot; 

Best Regards,

Nuno Ribeiro &amp; Roberto Paradinha

Hi Dragos,

Unfortunately we do not have the resources to upgrade to the latest SER, but I would say a partial patch would be suffice. We will try this out and if it works out fine we will then send the patch to the mailing list.

Regards,
Jos&#233; Carlos Silva

Assunto: Re: Handling early calls problem

Hi Nuno,

Upgrading to the latest SER will require a lot of resources. It takes a 
long time to port our SER changes to the newest version, make sure it 
works and then that our scenario are not broken. Unfortunately not all 
of our changes have been agreed as being positive by the SER community, 
so we have a slightly different SER now. I know that this would fix this 
issue and maybe many more others, but overall I doubt that it will be 
worth the trouble and the new issues that will emerge. Would a partial 
patch of only the respective SER bug-fix suffice? Or do you guys have 
the resources to do the upgrade (there are some scripts in the 
sip_router directory (near trunk) to streamline the process a little)?

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Dragos and all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm having a problem related with the &quot;early&quot; CANCEL's. The scenario 
</I>&gt;<i> is the following  one :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A PSTN call to a SIP phone. The PSTN caller decides to cancel the 
</I>&gt;<i> call  a few moments right after initiating, so the PSTN will send 
</I>&gt;<i> the CANCEL message. When it arrives to the I-CSCF  this one is 
</I>&gt;<i> discarded and not forwarded to the S-CSCF. So what happens is that we 
</I>&gt;<i> have a ghost call.... The PSTN has already cancelled the call but the 
</I>&gt;<i> SIP phone continues to ring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have looked into SER lists and saw that there was a thread about  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;handling of early CANCELs&quot;. I have  contacted  Andrei ( from the SER 
</I>&gt;<i> development) about this problem and after analyzing the current 
</I>&gt;<i> scenario he answered:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The problem is when the CANCEL arrives the INVITE transaction has not 
</I>&gt;<i> received any reply yet (if you look in the dump you'll see an 100 trying
</I>&gt;<i>  from .9 long after the CANCEL is received). In ser in this case 
</I>&gt;<i> (CANCEL  received and no response yet on a branch)  the branch is dropped
</I>&gt;<i>  immediately. The CANCEL is also not forwarded downstream (the  rfc 
</I>&gt;<i> says that CANCEL should be sent only on replied branches).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to make a long story short, upgrade to the latest cvs version and 
</I>&gt;<i> set  modparam(&quot;tm&quot;, &quot;cancel_b_method&quot;, 1). This will keep retransmitting
</I>&gt;<i>  the INVITE if no reply was received, even after the CANCEL arrives 
</I>&gt;<i> and  it will avoid all the above problems (see modules/tm/README |grep
</I>&gt;<i>  cancel_b_method for a more detailed description). If you still have 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, drop me another mail. I'm very interested if the cancel fix 
</I>&gt;<i> works properly, not only in my testbed. I'm starting to think that 
</I>&gt;<i> making this the default behavior might be a good idea (since it seems 
</I>&gt;<i> that it causes problems quite frequently). It might even become a 
</I>&gt;<i>  candidate for a backport to stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Andrei &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now we are thinking about how we should proceed. We think that this 
</I>&gt;<i> issue (ghost call) is very important to be solved in Open IMS Core's. 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you think this issue is important enough to update the SER version 
</I>&gt;<i> to the latest?  Or  we should  create a special logic in the t_fwd.c 
</I>&gt;<i> in order to forward the CANCEL even if the provisional answer is not 
</I>&gt;<i> received (it is against the RFC but will solve the problem...)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any other ideas?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in any advance.
