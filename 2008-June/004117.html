</I>Although I agree with you and think that a simpler solution is always 
better, especially for one AS to find another AS, the presence case is a 
perfect example to show how IMS can be useful. This is because the 
SUBSCRIBE request is addressed to the client and not to a presence 
server (anyway, Alice can't know whether Bob handles subscriptions 
himself or has an own presence server, or where this would be). So an 
IFC that triggers for both the registered and unregistered cases for 
termination cases is quite useful. So is the trigger for the PUBLISH on 
the originating side.

Without this IMS concepts a presence server would be quite hard to 
find/reach.

Otherwise I would add that routing a SUSCRIBE between AS1 and AS2 is not 
different from routing it from UE to AS2, except of course the UE-PCSCF 
part.

So Luca I don't see your issue exactly. The path from AS1 to AS2 was 
discovered during the SUBCRIBE transaction. The NOTIFY will be a 
subsequent message in the same dialog and as such re-use the dialog's 
path discovered in the initial SUBSCRIBE transaction. The path, as Franz 
wrote, is represented by the Record-Route values and the Contacts of the 
two sides.

Cheers,
