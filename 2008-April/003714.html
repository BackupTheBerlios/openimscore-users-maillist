Objective of the workshop

===================



The objective of the NGN-OPS workshop is to discuss the open source activities contributing to aspects Next Generation Networking (NGN),

mobile devices, development environment and open source technologies enabling in creating an open ecosystem. We are inviting both

theoretical, developmental and experimental papers as well as work-in-progress research projects. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:



    * Open Source software development projects and community efforts relating to

          o Next Generation Networking

          o Mobile Devices

          o Mobility Technologies

          o Pervasive Networking

          o Mobile Applications Development Frameworks and Tools

          o Deployment of Community Networks using Open Source

            software and tools



    * Open Standards efforts relating to

          o Next Generation Networking

          o Mobile Applications and Web 2.0

          o Network Management for NGNs



    * Open Source based

          o NGN Services prototypes

          o NGN Services test beds



    * Community based efforts in Wireless Networking



PAPER SUBMISSION:

=================



Full papers reporting original and unpublished research results on NGMAST topics are solicited. Submissions must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere while being evaluated for this conference.



* FORMATTING: The proceedings will be published by the prestigious IEEE Computer Society Press. Submissions must be in IEEE two-column format and must not exceed 6 pages, including figures, tables and references. The cover page should contain title, author names, affiliations, and email addresses. Please indicate clearly the corresponding author. Include up to five keywords from the above list and an abstract of no more than 300 words.



* HOW TO SUBMIT: The paper submission for IEEE NGNOPS 2008 will only be accepted through the EDAS Paper Submission System accessible from the link on the website. Only papers in PDF will be accepted for reviewing. Submissions as e-mail attachment will not be accepted.



* REVIEWING: Consistent with standard practice, each submitted paper will receive rigorous peer reviewing. Papers will be selected based on their originality, timeliness, significance, relevance and clarity of presentation. Selection will be based on full papers. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper, if accepted. All accepted papers of the conference are expected to be presented and will be included in the conference proceedings.



* CAMERA READY MANUSCRIPT: Accepted papers will need to be formatted in IEEE format (see publication guidelines on the conference website). Camera ready papers must be submitted directly to IEEE through a link that will be activated on the conference website. Again: Only PDF files will be accepted!
