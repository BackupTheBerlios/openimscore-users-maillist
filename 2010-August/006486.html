<PRE>Hi all,

I am receiving some error regarding to my DNS setting, which i suspect is
leading to error 478 &lt;Unresolvable Destination&gt; and error 500 &lt;Error
forwarding to home domain&gt; when i am going to register my users.

I want to clear some doubts regarding this DNS issue. Basically 2 issues i
want to get cleared about -

1. Now according to the installation procedure which i am following in the
website , i see that the file &quot;/etc/bind/named.conf&quot; will contain 4
individual file names who are as follows -

include &quot;/etc/bind/named.conf.options&quot;;
include &quot;/etc/bind/named.conf.local&quot;;
include &quot;/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones&quot;;
include &quot;/etc/bind/open-ims.dnszone&quot;;

** Now the funny thing is happening, when i am commenting the last include
which is &quot; etc/bind/open-ims.dnszone&quot; file the bind is working perfectly but
when i am commenting it out, the bind9 server fails to start. But according
to the installation rules this file must be UNCOMMENTED and should be placed
at this bind location after being copied from opt/OpenIMSCore/ser_ims/cfg.

At this point when i apply to see the error log trace with &quot;tail
/var/log/daemon.log&quot; the error trace that comes up is as follows -

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-users">root at sougata-desktop</A>:/# tail /var/log/daemon.log
Aug 25 15:10:48 sougata-desktop named[4668]: loading configuration from

Aug 25 15:10:48 sougata-desktop named[4668]: loading configuration:
unexpected token
Aug 25 15:10:48 sougata-desktop named[4668]: exiting (due to fatal error)

According to the error trace, errors are in open-ims.dnszone file. Now i
can't figure it out from where does this error traces coming.
I am attaching the open-ims.dnszone with this mail for your comments. Now
when i am trying to get my users registered at my open-ims.sougata i am
getting Error 478&lt;Unresolvable Destination&gt; and Error 500&lt;Error forwarding
to home domain&gt;. Is these 2 errors are due to this DNS error which i am
receiving. I mean to say are they getting generated due to no resolvable dns
address?

2. Second issue is regarding resolv.conf file. Now as per my understanding
this file will indicate the DNS which i want to work with and in this
situation the installed DNS for openimscore is being installed on my own pc.

My pc IP - 10.80.4.244
My domain name - open-ims.sougata

As my pc is behind university firewall so obviously this resolve.conf is
already containing my university DNS ip address which is 193.145.56.11 for
staying connected to outside internet.

So i have updated my resolv.conf with having 2 nameservers one the
university DNS and another my own DNS

So my resolve.conf file is looking like -

# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 193.145.56.11
nameserver 10.80.4.244
search open-ims.sougata
domain open-ims.sougata

My question in this case, is this OK ? I mean to say that declaring 2 DNS
servers in a single resolv.conf file one for the university dns which is
helping me staying connected to the internet and another to my own personal
DNS for open-ims.core.

Is this file gets generated by the network manager whenever i am starting my
network connections , because i am noticing that sometimes my own declared
DNS IP (10.80.4.244) along with the search and domain options getting
vanished from this file leaving just the nameserver 193.145.56.11. Why this
change is taking place?

CAN ANYONE KINDLY HELP ME IN CLEARING THESE 2 DOUBTS ?

Regards,

Sougata
