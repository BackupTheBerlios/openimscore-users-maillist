Hi All,

 

I was looking for the sip2ims gateway module in the currently available openIMSCore source code. Looks 

like it is not a part of the openIMSCore build anymore. Is it possible to get this module from old versions of 

openIMSCore. If so, Can anyone please suggest how to get it. 

 

Thanks,

kavitha

Hi Franz / Dragos,
 
I saw the discussion on IMS-PSTN calls. 
 
Can you please suggest any open source PSTN gateway compatible with OpenIMSCore  to make IMS-PSTN calls?
 
We thought of using OpenIMSCore with Asterisk. 
But lot of users seem to have faced inter operability issues between openIMSCore and Asterisk.   Any suggestion on how to make Asterisk work with OpenIMSCore.
 
 
 
Regards
kavitha

Hi Mark,

Well, we actually have it working and I can't think of any worth
mentioning changes to the configuration files. In the past we had some
Cisco Gateways and now we mainly use Cantata and Teles MGWs. Sometimes
you'll want to add something like a SER MRFC in-between, if the MGW does
not behave properly.

For simple PSTN-to-IMS termination, you should route everything to the
I-CSCF. Routing to S-CSCF is always bad, as maybe you have multiple ones
and you don't know which one to choose.

Then, a nice trick is to do PSTN &quot;origination&quot;. So if you'd want to have
IMS services also applied for the originating PSTN users, you can
trigger this by adding a Route: &lt;sip:orig at originating.users.domain&gt;.
Then just route this normally to the right I-CSCF, which will find a
suitable originating S-CSCF and apply services there. Just be careful
that the PSTN user will not be registered in the IMS sense, but
unregistered. Also, obviously there's no P-CSCF involved in the
originating part, so be carefull about security.

As extra information, MSF actually standardized a TRC(F) function. The
TRansit Controller would use ENUM to determine whether and where the
originating and terminating users are to be serviced. I have changed the
enum module in ser_ims to allow also for ENUM queries on the originating
users (with the limitation that it does not fork the requests now if
there are multiple options on the originating side, only takes the first
one) - <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=579">http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/openimscore?view=rev&amp;rev=579</A> .

I am attaching an example trcf.cfg. If anyone finds it useful and
actually working, then I will add this to the project's cscf.cfg examples.

Cheers,
-Dragos


 



&gt;<i> We have an IMS Telephone Application Server operating with the open core,
</I>&gt;<i> is it possible to configure the core such that an IMS originating call can
</I>&gt;<i> terminate on the PSTN - if the terminating user is not configured on the
</I>&gt;<i> HSS can the call be routed to a default server (BGCF) which would then
</I>&gt;<i> select the required MGCF.
</I>
Yes, of course.

Franz
