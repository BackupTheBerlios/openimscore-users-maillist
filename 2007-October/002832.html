<PRE>Hello Mark,

No problem for the bug report. I am sorry though that I filled one and
not just fixed the issue immediately, but unfortunately we do not have
all the resources we would like to.

I agree with you on the specs, yet you are a little too much 3GPP
centric ;-). We are also trying to look at what TISPAN/CableLabs think
about the registration process and also what actually is required at the
moment in the real world. And the reality is that only a very small
percentage of our users have actually such 3GPP clients that support the
IPSec SAs. I would say that overall there were just a couple of such UEs
that have been tested with the OpenIMSCore, so obviously there are still
things to fix.


Although I am not sure on what precisely we disagree as I agree with
most of your comments, I will try to answer.

On Contact header: if you just read the 3GPP standards, your reasoning
is somehow correct. But I would still insist that according to pure SIP
methodology, you are wrong a little wrong if you would change the
Contact header. The Contact header is used during registration to
indicate to a registrar what is the mapping between an identity and a
reachable network address. The 2 (or 3 for AKA SQN synchronization) step
process is specific to 3GPP. The general case is that if the registrar
accepts the registration it should save and map the found contact
addresses to the identity communicated. If it does not trust the
message, it could choose to challenge the originator. Then the
originator should &quot;resubmit&quot; (this is term used by RFC3261) the request
with a challenge response. Yes, it is not mandatory that you do not
change the headers and actually you must for some, yet I interpret this
as meaning that I should just resend what I sent before, but this time
with authentication data.

Why would you actually benefit from using different contact addresses?
If you think about opening the ports later on the UE on a need-only
basis, well, it might be that you fail later and it's too late as you
already fixed them in the 1st REGISTER.

And the thing is that the core could decide to accept your 1st REGISTER
without challenging you, like it does in Early-IMS or NASS-Bundled
authentication or if you disable the authentication. So you must present
a real Contact as you don't know how or even if you will be challenged?

Well, anyway. This was just a recommendation from me. Take as a free
developer insight and disregard if you think that I am wrong.

But let's see why it works when you don't change this. This contact data
is used and saved mainly on the S-CSCF.The thing is that in our
particular implementation the P-CSCF data is kept in a reversed
registrar. That means that for efficiency as the P-CSCF identifies users
by originating addresses (not identities) and as such the data is
indexed (hashed actually) by (host,port). In the first REGISTER step,
because we need to keep the data until the 2nd step, an entry is created
in the registrar and the user is set to a not-registered state (if it
was not registered before). Attached to this, the initial SA data is
saved. On the 2nd step, the P-CSCF will try to identify the originator
by the Via header. So this would have to match the contact address saved
in the first step. Well, it doesn't, so the P-CSCF probably thinks that
this is a new user and creates a new contact entry. The first SA
succeeded because the other entry was there, but this new one has no
IPSec entries as the first step of the negotiation process was lost for
this new contact.

Ideally, the P-CSCF should be able to identify the UE by the SA channel
only. Yet this is not enough for non-3GPP IMS use. And unfortunately our
P-CSCF does not have this capability at all as this data is not relayed
from the Linux kernel IPSec implementation to SER.

To conclude: Yes, there is a bug in handling such cases. I did not
thought about this case when you would not come with 2 different Contact
addresses when this was implemented. The bug is not in setting the SAs,
but in identifying the UE. I have also updated the bug-tracker to better
describe the actual issue. Sorry, but I am just making assumptions until
I will have the time to actually replicate the scenario and debug it.

This I hope this closes the first of your conclusions (that the
UE/P-CSCF should use the ports in the Security Headers for SAs). Yes,
this is what happens. The issue was different.

Then on 2nd conclusion (different ports for protected/unprotected). Yes,
the client should do that. The P-CSCF - the story is a little more complex:
1. by default configuration provided, just 1 port is used for all
messages. This seems to be enough for most cases
2. you can reconfigure the P-CSCF to use 2 ports, yet it is impossible
for now to decide on which one to use when sending out data, due to core
SER architectural design. I think that I have seen some changes in the
SER CVS lately related to this, but I don't know much about it. Again,
it is unfeasible and not worth for our purposes for now to do this.
3. using 1 port for unprotected and 1 or 2 ports for each client - this
is quite bad from the scaling perspective as you run out quite soon of
ports (yes, you can have more IPs, do some hacks, but if you can
without, it's worth saving the trouble). The only case when this is
required is for when you have multiple clients using the same IP:port,
but this is unrealistic.

If you choose options 1 for the P-CSCF as we do now, the UE must use
different ports or else it won't work. So, of course that we are not
forcing the UE to use the same port.

The actual issue at hand is more related to handling the contact. The
P-CSCF tries to do a NAT forward, towards the source of the request. It
was not supposed to do this if there are IPSec SAs there, but obviously
the P_security_relay() fails and P_NAT_relay() is overzealous (pcscf.cfg
- lines 315-316).

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Based on 3GPP 33.203 it is reasonable to assume that UE will use
</I>&gt;<i> different ports for Secured and Un Secured messages. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This being the case the Initial Registration message will be sent from
</I>&gt;<i> the unsecured port. This from TS 33.203 para 7.1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The UE associates two ports, called port_us and port_uc, with each
</I>&gt;<i> pair of security associations established in an authenticated
</I>&gt;<i> registration. The ports port_us and port_uc are different from the
</I>&gt;<i> standard SIP ports 5060 and 5061. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports
</I>&gt;<i> port_us and port_uc. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be received on
</I>&gt;<i> any port which is different from the ports port_us and port_uc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The number of the ports port_us and port_uc are communicated to the
</I>&gt;<i> P-CSCF during the security mode set-up procedure, cf. clause 7.2. These
</I>&gt;<i> ports are used with both, UDP and TCP
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a similar requirement for the P-CSCF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, the ports declared in the Via and Contact in the 1
</I>&gt;<i> REGISTER and 2 REGISTER messages will very likely be different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the UE initially registers (i.e. no security associations exist)
</I>&gt;<i> the first REGISTER message will contain
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a)	in the Via header - the IP Address and Port number that the UE
</I>&gt;<i> is expecting the P-SCSF to send it's (401) response (the port number
</I>&gt;<i> will be an unprotected port)
</I>&gt;<i> b)	in the Contact header - the IP address that the UE would expect
</I>&gt;<i> future Requests to be sent to. A port number IS NOT required, but if it
</I>&gt;<i> is included it should be set to the same port as described in a) above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the Second REGISTER message (in response to the P-CSCFs challenge to
</I>&gt;<i> the first REGISTER)  will contain
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> c)	in the Via Header - the IP Address and Port number that the UE
</I>&gt;<i> is expecting the P-SCSF to send it's response (the port number will be
</I>&gt;<i> the UEs protected Server port port_us, assuming UDP is used)
</I>&gt;<i> d)	in the Contact header - the IP address that UE would expect
</I>&gt;<i> future Requests to be sent to. A port number IS required (by 3GPP
</I>&gt;<i> standards) and will be the UEs protected Server port port_us, for the
</I>&gt;<i> UDP case) This is specified in  TS 24.229 para 5.1.1.2. d)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> a Contact header set to include SIP URI(s) containing the IP address of
</I>&gt;<i> the UE in the hostport parameter or FQDN. ............If the REGISTER
</I>&gt;<i> request is protected by a security association, the UE shall also
</I>&gt;<i> include the protected server port value in the hostport parameter;
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So in conclusion;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Security associations used by the UE and P-CSCF should use the ports
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the Security Client and Security Server headers and NOT
</I>&gt;<i> Contacts or Vias. The contact and vias in the protected 2nd REGISTER
</I>&gt;<i> will reflect this. The unprotected and protected REGISTER messages WILL
</I>&gt;<i> come from different ports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The UE and P-CSCF MUST used different ports for protected and
</I>&gt;<i> unprotected messages as defined in TS 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the P-CSCF receives the 401 challenge from the S-CSCF it should set
</I>&gt;<i> up temporary security associations (based on Sec server/sec client). The
</I>&gt;<i> P-CSCF should expect the 2 REGISTER message to arrive (protected) at its
</I>&gt;<i> protected Server port from the UEs Protected Client port. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The 200OK from S-CSCF to the P-CSCF should be used to convert the
</I>&gt;<i> temporary SAs to new SAs (update the SA expiry).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your BUG fix when implemented should support the above operation and not
</I>&gt;<i> force the UE to use the same ports for protected and unprotected
</I>&gt;<i> messages. The P-CSCF should use different ports for protected and
</I>&gt;<i> unprotected messages.

</I>&gt;<i>  Hello Soshant,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  I think that the SAs are always created, just that it is not used if
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>  2nd contact is different.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  Well, you shouldn't change the contact between the 2 messages - the 2nd
</I>&gt;<i>  REGISTER should basically be a resend of the first with the extra
</I>&gt;<i>  authorization information.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  Anyway, the fact that this might happen means that it might be a
</I>&gt;<i>  security issue.  So the way it works is that on the 401 just one SA is
</I>&gt;<i>  set, for receiving the next 401. This is because the client might  not
</I>&gt;<i>  know the secret anyway and this might just be a DoS attach. The other 3
</I>&gt;<i>  SAs are set just before the 200 OK is sent.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  In your case, the problem is that the IPSec info is saved on the first
</I>&gt;<i>  REGISTER and then re-used on the 2nd to set the SAs, but those were
</I>&gt;<i>  wrong and as such not used. So we need to actually update the IPSec
</I>&gt;<i> info
</I>&gt;<i>  based on the info in the 200 OK, which is the info to trust as the
</I>&gt;<i>  REGISTER was authenticated.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  I have filled a bug report here: <A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/node/115">http://www.openimscore.org/node/115</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  But in any case, I would recommend that you do not change the Contact
</I>&gt;<i>  during the registration.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  Cheers,
