<PRE>Hi Mikael,

&gt;<i> I'm working on putting together a VMware-Image for use in education.
</I>
Fine, I have done the same.

&gt;<i> Would it be possible for me to get a copy of your image?
</I>
Yes, of course. I you have a fileserver where I can upload 670 MByte.
The actual version I use is revision 455.

&gt;<i> How do you solve the problem with having a preconfigured image and DNS. Do
</I>&gt;<i> you use DHCP for VMware? Does each image contain their own DNS? Would you
</I>&gt;<i> like to explain how you do?
</I>
I don't have DHCP in VMware. There are two working scenarios. 

The first one uses the isolated &quot;Host only&quot; mode in VMware networking. This
works immediately if you configure your VMnet1 interface correctly.

The second (more comfortable) uses &quot;bridged mode&quot; and receives an IP address
from an external DHCP server (to be precise: I have it configured
statically). In this mode both host and guest have access to the internet.
This mode requires some adaptations in networking due to the local
environment.

I use a DNS server inside of VMware guest. It is pre-configured for three
test networks. So it is easy to e.g start a second image and build up a four
network roaming scenario.

&gt;<i> Do you have a build system to create the image and to keep it up to date?
</I>No. I use the &quot;configurator.sh&quot; to make the necessary adaptations. It takes
me in total about 20 min to update OpenIMScore (a fresh compilation),
because I have done it very often.

&gt;<i> Does it only contain OpenIMSCore or other IMS related components?
</I>
Yes. I have also inside:
- SER + SEMS
- Openser
- SIPp

I have attached the README file (How to use the VMware image and what is
inside) to show the support I give to the students.
There is also an &quot;install.log&quot; file where all steps of building the system
are documented.

cheers
Franz
