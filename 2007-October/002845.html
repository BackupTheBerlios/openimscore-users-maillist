Subject: 	[Open IMS Core] The Open IMS Core workshop in Berlin is
approaching, users speak up &amp; recent project developments

Dear all,

some months have passed since the last release of this newsletter so we figured
it is time to give you some updates on what happened around the Open IMS Core
project. 
First of all: we are very pleased by the positive reception that this project
for specialist software got in the first months of its existence. Since last
November we have had more than 16.000 unique visitors to the webpages and have
received a lot of good feedback for the software. Thanks for this ! The OSIMS
developer community is constantly growing and we are glad that a lot more
people now are dealing with concepts for IMS service delivery.

The main points that we want to illustrate in this newsletter are:

1) The Open IMS Core has been lifted to support convergent IMS authentication

&gt;<i>From revision 371 we have merged the work on the RevampDB branch into the trunk
</I>of the FOKUS HSS. With this update you to get to more Rel. 6 features like e.g.
the support for implicitly registered sets, capability selection or updates on
the Sh interface. Additionally. since revision 434, there is work going on in a
branch to support the dynamic service activation feature for Sh.
Taking into account the work of standard organizations other than 3GPP (and to
also offer more possibilities for our users), the Open IMS Core project has
been extended in a first step towards converged authentication. As such,
support for MD5 client authentication has been extended beyond FOKUS' 3GPP
AKA-to-MD5 derivation to support both CableLabs PacketCable 2.0 Digest and ETSI
TISPAN DIGEST MD5 authentication schemes. In the same step a support for
Early-IMS authentication and NASS-Bundled mechanisms has been included,
bringing the total number of authentication methods available in the Open IMS
Core to 7.

2) New P-CSCF security architecture

The P-CSCF implementation of the Gm interface has been extended to support
alternative security methods beyond the 3GPP recommended IPSec. Now, it is also
possible to use TLS, which, unlike IPSec, does not require support for the AKA
authentication. In this context, legacy UEs can now be used together with the
Open IMS Core in a secure manner.

3) Work in progress on the Policy and Charging Functionality

Currently we are working on enabling a consolidated Diameter session support in
our stacks. This goes in parallel with the implementation of the Rx/Gq
interfaces and the Rf revamp in the cdp_sessions branch. As in all the other
areas, any developer help that would accelerate the implementation would be
highly appreciated since we are only a small team to work on extensions. See
details on how to browse the SVN repository on
<A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/download">http://www.openimscore.org/download</A> 

4) Open IMS Core users speak up

We have no means of tracing what people and also companies are using the Open
IMS Core for but in some cases we did receive some feedback. See for yourself
what some users of the software have written to us (of course you can also
write to us if you are having a cool Open IMS Core related project or
application that you would want to see listed) on www.openimscore.org/quotes

5) Open IMS Core Workshop @ the 3rd International FOKUS IMS Workshop 2007

On November 15th 2007, we have a slot for speaking on the Open IMS Core project
in an afternoon workshop session at the 3rd FOKUS IMS Workshop &quot;IMS Deployment
reviewed in Face of Triple Play, IPTV, SOA and Web 2.0&quot; called &quot;Open IMS Core -
Applications of the software in the industry &amp; academia and what to target
next&quot;. You will see presentations of universities, telco and vendor R&amp;D
departments on how they use the software. We are looking forward to a
discussion on what features should be worked on in the coming months. See
details for the workshop and make suggestions on what we should put on the
aganda there on www.openimscore.org/meetings

The online registration for the event is only open for a few more days, so in
case you want to join us in Berlin please visit
<A HREF="http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/go/ims-event">http://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/go/ims-event</A> to catch up with details on
registration and the most recent program updates and travel hints.

We are looking forward to seeing some of you in Berlin and to your comments on
the website or the mailing lists.

Your Open IMS Core team.
