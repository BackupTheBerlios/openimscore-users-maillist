<PRE>Hi Dragos 

Thanks for the reply and feedback. I think the proposed fix will help
somewhat. Now just to get the P-CSCF (SER) to use different ports for
the protected and unprotected messages..... :-(

I don't think we really disagree on anything major here now that you
know that we have a very heavy 3GPP(2) bias :-)

We don't see port exhaustion as a risk or issue we have to deal with
this with Media Relays and Media Gateways so using more IPs or other
techniques are not huge issue. 

I've registered for the IMS Workshop next month so we could discuss
further if necessary

Cheers

Mark

 Hello Mark,
 
 No problem for the bug report. I am sorry though that I filled one and
 not just fixed the issue immediately, but unfortunately we do not have
 all the resources we would like to.
 
 I agree with you on the specs, yet you are a little too much 3GPP
 centric ;-). We are also trying to look at what TISPAN/CableLabs think
 about the registration process and also what actually is required at
the
 moment in the real world. And the reality is that only a very small
 percentage of our users have actually such 3GPP clients that support
the
 IPSec SAs. I would say that overall there were just a couple of such
UEs
 that have been tested with the OpenIMSCore, so obviously there are
still
 things to fix.
 
 
 Although I am not sure on what precisely we disagree as I agree with
 most of your comments, I will try to answer.
 
 On Contact header: if you just read the 3GPP standards, your reasoning
 is somehow correct. But I would still insist that according to pure SIP
 methodology, you are wrong a little wrong if you would change the
 Contact header. The Contact header is used during registration to
 indicate to a registrar what is the mapping between an identity and a
 reachable network address. The 2 (or 3 for AKA SQN synchronization)
step
 process is specific to 3GPP. The general case is that if the registrar
 accepts the registration it should save and map the found contact
 addresses to the identity communicated. If it does not trust the
 message, it could choose to challenge the originator. Then the
 originator should &quot;resubmit&quot; (this is term used by RFC3261) the request
 with a challenge response. Yes, it is not mandatory that you do not
 change the headers and actually you must for some, yet I interpret this
 as meaning that I should just resend what I sent before, but this time
 with authentication data.
 
 Why would you actually benefit from using different contact addresses?
 If you think about opening the ports later on the UE on a need-only
 basis, well, it might be that you fail later and it's too late as you
 already fixed them in the 1st REGISTER.
 
 And the thing is that the core could decide to accept your 1st REGISTER
 without challenging you, like it does in Early-IMS or NASS-Bundled
 authentication or if you disable the authentication. So you must
present
 a real Contact as you don't know how or even if you will be challenged?
 
 Well, anyway. This was just a recommendation from me. Take as a free
 developer insight and disregard if you think that I am wrong.
 
 But let's see why it works when you don't change this. This contact
data
 is used and saved mainly on the S-CSCF.The thing is that in our
 particular implementation the P-CSCF data is kept in a reversed
 registrar. That means that for efficiency as the P-CSCF identifies
users
 by originating addresses (not identities) and as such the data is
 indexed (hashed actually) by (host,port). In the first REGISTER step,
 because we need to keep the data until the 2nd step, an entry is
created
 in the registrar and the user is set to a not-registered state (if it
 was not registered before). Attached to this, the initial SA data is
 saved. On the 2nd step, the P-CSCF will try to identify the originator
 by the Via header. So this would have to match the contact address
saved
 in the first step. Well, it doesn't, so the P-CSCF probably thinks that
 this is a new user and creates a new contact entry. The first SA
 succeeded because the other entry was there, but this new one has no
 IPSec entries as the first step of the negotiation process was lost for
 this new contact.
 
 Ideally, the P-CSCF should be able to identify the UE by the SA channel
 only. Yet this is not enough for non-3GPP IMS use. And unfortunately
our
 P-CSCF does not have this capability at all as this data is not relayed
 from the Linux kernel IPSec implementation to SER.
 
 To conclude: Yes, there is a bug in handling such cases. I did not
 thought about this case when you would not come with 2 different
Contact
 addresses when this was implemented. The bug is not in setting the SAs,
 but in identifying the UE. I have also updated the bug-tracker to
better
 describe the actual issue. Sorry, but I am just making assumptions
until
 I will have the time to actually replicate the scenario and debug it.
 
 This I hope this closes the first of your conclusions (that the
 UE/P-CSCF should use the ports in the Security Headers for SAs). Yes,
 this is what happens. The issue was different.
 
 Then on 2nd conclusion (different ports for protected/unprotected).
Yes,
 the client should do that. The P-CSCF - the story is a little more
complex:
 1. by default configuration provided, just 1 port is used for all
 messages. This seems to be enough for most cases
 2. you can reconfigure the P-CSCF to use 2 ports, yet it is impossible
 for now to decide on which one to use when sending out data, due to
core
 SER architectural design. I think that I have seen some changes in the
 SER CVS lately related to this, but I don't know much about it. Again,
 it is unfeasible and not worth for our purposes for now to do this.
 3. using 1 port for unprotected and 1 or 2 ports for each client - this
 is quite bad from the scaling perspective as you run out quite soon of
 ports (yes, you can have more IPs, do some hacks, but if you can
 without, it's worth saving the trouble). The only case when this is
 required is for when you have multiple clients using the same IP:port,
 but this is unrealistic.
 
 If you choose options 1 for the P-CSCF as we do now, the UE must use
 different ports or else it won't work. So, of course that we are not
 forcing the UE to use the same port.
 
 The actual issue at hand is more related to handling the contact. The
 P-CSCF tries to do a NAT forward, towards the source of the request. It
 was not supposed to do this if there are IPSec SAs there, but obviously
 the P_security_relay() fails and P_NAT_relay() is overzealous
(pcscf.cfg
 - lines 315-316).

 &gt; Hi Dragos
 &gt;
 &gt; Thanks for including a bug report. However we don't entirely agree
with
 &gt; your synopsis.
 &gt;
 &gt; Based on 3GPP 33.203 it is reasonable to assume that UE will use
 &gt; different ports for Secured and Un Secured messages.
 &gt;
 &gt; This being the case the Initial Registration message will be sent
from
 &gt; the unsecured port. This from TS 33.203 para 7.1
 &gt;
 &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
 &gt; 2. The UE associates two ports, called port_us and port_uc, with each
 &gt; pair of security associations established in an authenticated
 &gt; registration. The ports port_us and port_uc are different from the
 &gt; standard SIP ports 5060 and 5061.
 &gt;
 &gt; No unprotected messages shall be sent from or received on the ports
 &gt; port_us and port_uc.
 &gt;
 &gt; &gt;From a security point of view, unprotected messages may be received
on
 &gt; any port which is different from the ports port_us and port_uc.
 &gt;
 &gt; The number of the ports port_us and port_uc are communicated to the
 &gt; P-CSCF during the security mode set-up procedure, cf. clause 7.2.
These
 &gt; ports are used with both, UDP and TCP
 &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; There is a similar requirement for the P-CSCF.
 &gt;
 &gt; Additionally, the ports declared in the Via and Contact in the 1
 &gt; REGISTER and 2 REGISTER messages will very likely be different.
 &gt;
 &gt; When the UE initially registers (i.e. no security associations exist)
 &gt; the first REGISTER message will contain
 &gt;
 &gt; a)	in the Via header - the IP Address and Port number that the UE
 &gt; is expecting the P-SCSF to send it's (401) response (the port number
 &gt; will be an unprotected port)
 &gt; b)	in the Contact header - the IP address that the UE would expect
 &gt; future Requests to be sent to. A port number IS NOT required, but if
it
 &gt; is included it should be set to the same port as described in a)
above.
 &gt;
 &gt; In the Second REGISTER message (in response to the P-CSCFs challenge
to
 &gt; the first REGISTER)  will contain
 &gt;
 &gt; c)	in the Via Header - the IP Address and Port number that the UE
 &gt; is expecting the P-SCSF to send it's response (the port number will
be
 &gt; the UEs protected Server port port_us, assuming UDP is used)
 &gt; d)	in the Contact header - the IP address that UE would expect
 &gt; future Requests to be sent to. A port number IS required (by 3GPP
 &gt; standards) and will be the UEs protected Server port port_us, for the
 &gt; UDP case) This is specified in  TS 24.229 para 5.1.1.2. d)
 &gt;
 &gt; &lt;snip&gt;
 &gt; a Contact header set to include SIP URI(s) containing the IP address
of
 &gt; the UE in the hostport parameter or FQDN. ............If the REGISTER
 &gt; request is protected by a security association, the UE shall also
 &gt; include the protected server port value in the hostport parameter;
 &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; So in conclusion;
 &gt;
 &gt; The Security associations used by the UE and P-CSCF should use the
ports
 &gt; defined in the Security Client and Security Server headers and NOT
 &gt; Contacts or Vias. The contact and vias in the protected 2nd REGISTER
 &gt; will reflect this. The unprotected and protected REGISTER messages
WILL
 &gt; come from different ports.
 &gt;
 &gt; The UE and P-CSCF MUST used different ports for protected and
 &gt; unprotected messages as defined in TS 33.203.
 &gt;
 &gt; When the P-CSCF receives the 401 challenge from the S-CSCF it should
set
 &gt; up temporary security associations (based on Sec server/sec client).
The
 &gt; P-CSCF should expect the 2 REGISTER message to arrive (protected) at
its
 &gt; protected Server port from the UEs Protected Client port.
 &gt;
 &gt; The 200OK from S-CSCF to the P-CSCF should be used to convert the
 &gt; temporary SAs to new SAs (update the SA expiry).
 &gt;
 &gt; Your BUG fix when implemented should support the above operation and
not
 &gt; force the UE to use the same ports for protected and unprotected
 &gt; messages. The P-CSCF should use different ports for protected and
 &gt; unprotected messages.

 &gt;
 &gt;  Hello Soshant,
 &gt;
 &gt;  I think that the SAs are always created, just that it is not used if
 &gt; the
 &gt;  2nd contact is different.
 &gt;
 &gt;  Well, you shouldn't change the contact between the 2 messages - the
2nd
 &gt;  REGISTER should basically be a resend of the first with the extra
 &gt;  authorization information.
 &gt;
 &gt;  Anyway, the fact that this might happen means that it might be a
 &gt;  security issue.  So the way it works is that on the 401 just one SA
is
 &gt;  set, for receiving the next 401. This is because the client might
not
 &gt;  know the secret anyway and this might just be a DoS attach. The
other 3
 &gt;  SAs are set just before the 200 OK is sent.
 &gt;
 &gt;  In your case, the problem is that the IPSec info is saved on the
first
 &gt;  REGISTER and then re-used on the 2nd to set the SAs, but those were
 &gt;  wrong and as such not used. So we need to actually update the IPSec
 &gt; info
 &gt;  based on the info in the 200 OK, which is the info to trust as the
 &gt;  REGISTER was authenticated.
 &gt;
 &gt;  I have filled a bug report here: <A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/node/115">http://www.openimscore.org/node/115</A>
 &gt;
 &gt;  But in any case, I would recommend that you do not change the
Contact
 &gt;  during the registration.
 &gt;
 &gt;  Cheers,

 &gt;  &gt; We are trying to register a UE with OpenIMS using IPSec/AKA. On
 &gt;  &gt; receiving the 401 challenge from pcscf, the UE sends second
Register
 &gt;  &gt; to pcscf that is encrypted using ipsec. This register is decrypted
 &gt;  &gt; fine by the pcscf. However the pcscf does not encrypt the 200ok it
 &gt;  &gt; sends back to the UE. The 200 ok is sent in plain text to the UE.
We
 &gt;  &gt; checked and found out that the pcscf does not create a security
 &gt;  &gt; association in the direction from pcscf to the UE. It only creates
 &gt;  &gt; security association in the direction from the UE to the pcscf.
The
 &gt;  &gt; attached trace, trace1.pcap shows this.
 &gt;  &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; We changed the contact field in the first register to match the
 &gt;  &gt; contact field in the second register and in this case the security
 &gt;  &gt; associations are created fine in both directions. This is shown in
 &gt;  &gt; trace2.pcap that is attached.
 &gt;  &gt;
 &gt;  &gt; Is this expected behavior? What is the reasoning for making the
pcscf
 &gt;  &gt; match the contact field of the two register messages before
deciding
 &gt;  &gt; whether or not to create a security association in the reverse
 &gt; direction?
