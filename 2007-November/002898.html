<PRE>Hi,

Does anyone have a recommendation for a client for IPSec AKA and
OpenIMSCore?

I need the client to be on a linux server remote from the OpenIMS
installation.

First, I tried the patched version of SIPP available on openimscore.org, but
ran into the same problems as described on this list by Jamal back on Thu
Sep 13 17:04:31 CEST 2007 :

Dragos,

This doesnt seem to be the right venue - but using the excuse of being a




newbie:
Who should i be sending this to?

1) regIPSEC1.xml has an error on incoming reply advertises SPI as 2048
and passing to the ipsec scripts 2028; so the last (encrypted) 200 OK is
never seen.




2) regIPSEC3.xml fails to process the last 200 OK because some previous
state is expected to be saved prior to validating the regexp.
In the case of this script the Cseq: header is expected to have already


been known before the 200 Ok is received. I have a small patch that sort

of says to sipp &quot;assume cseq = blah&quot;.

None of these issues will be seen if you run sipp, and the rest of
openims on the same node.



cheers,
jamal


Then I tried IMS Communicator, but it doesn't yet support IPSec, just the
AKA headers in SIP.

I tried OpenIC Lite, but it was adding multiple P-Access-Network-Info
headers, which my P-CSCF (not the OpenIMS P-CSCF) correctly rejects.

I was unable to install UCT IMS Client - perhaps if someone has been
successful with this client, then I can revisit the installation.

Cheers,

Marc
