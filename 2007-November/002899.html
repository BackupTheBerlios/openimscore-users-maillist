<PRE>Hi Marc,

 

I had the same problem with clients you mentioned, that's why I'm using
SIPp...

The first error is easily solved when the single SPI set to 2028 is changed
to 2048. At this point you might be able to register to open-ims (I needed
some minor changes, by setting timers and removing files), just the
regIPSEC3.xml is closed with an error-message (I didn't care much about that
yet because I just wanted to register over IPSec).

What do you plan to test with your client?

 

Br, Klemens

Subject: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Client for IPSec AKA remotely from OpenIMSCore

 

Hi,

Does anyone have a recommendation for a client for IPSec AKA and
OpenIMSCore? 

I need the client to be on a linux server remote from the OpenIMS
installation.

First, I tried the patched version of SIPP available on openimscore.org
&lt;<A HREF="http://openimscore.org/">http://openimscore.org/</A>&gt; , but ran into the same problems as described on
this list by Jamal back on Thu Sep 13 17:04:31 CEST 2007 :

Dragos,





This doesnt seem to be the right venue - but using the excuse of being a















newbie:


Who should i be sending this to?





1) regIPSEC1.xml has an error on incoming reply advertises SPI as 2048


and passing to the ipsec scripts 2028; so the last (encrypted) 200 OK is






never seen.














2) regIPSEC3.xml fails to process the last 200 OK because some previous


state is expected to be saved prior to validating the regexp. 


In the case of this script the Cseq: header is expected to have already









been known before the 200 Ok is received. I have a small patch that sort





of says to sipp &quot;assume cseq = blah&quot;.





None of these issues will be seen if you run sipp, and the rest of


openims on the same node.












cheers,


jamal


Then I tried IMS Communicator, but it doesn't yet support IPSec, just the
AKA headers in SIP. 

I tried OpenIC Lite, but it was adding multiple P-Access-Network-Info
headers, which my P-CSCF (not the OpenIMS P-CSCF) correctly rejects.

I was unable to install UCT IMS Client - perhaps if someone has been
successful with this client, then I can revisit the installation. 

Cheers,

Marc
