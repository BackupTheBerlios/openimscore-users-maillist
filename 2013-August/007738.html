<PRE>Hi Vladimir,

I was considering GPS coordinates.

The client an IMS client will be registering itself with this AS and sends periodically this information to the same AS, in return the AS looks up the area of interest and decide to reply to the client with information he might be interested onto receiving.
PCRF is an option for sure, but I was considering IMS to provide a kind of service chain to this subscriber say for example


-          Client sends his GPS coordinates to AS1

-          AS checks within a radius of 1 km if there are some vegetarian restaurants

-          AS returns the results to the client with the option to click2call to make reservation

-          Client calls and service chain complete

Thanks
Mehdi

Hello!
&gt;<i>From what source your AS will be get location info?
</I>In our network we use PCRF as location info source. Any application interested in user location can call REST HTTP method and get user location by subscriber location or even by IP. No IMS components involved in this process.

Hi All,

I am looking for some advise, and will really appreciate any feedback regarding the following topic.

The idea is to have a end to end LBS implemented and verified on IMS, the main components of the solution will be: The OpenImsCore, Application Server(s), Client (LBS enabled). My questions are the following:

Application Server Part:
The goal  is to implement various ways of communicating targeted advertisements to the registered clients based on their geo locations. What would be the best and comprehensive platform for developing such an AS, would it be easy and straight forward to use Mobicents for example ? or any other additional enablers you could recommend ?

Client Part :
Is there any client available to verify end to end implementation and test it thoroughly. This part is a main concern as I'm afraid to run into client specific issue and won't ultimately be able to test the AS, I won't mind to test using an emulator or similar :).

Kind Regards
Mehdi
