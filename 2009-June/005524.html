<PRE>Dear Peter,

many thanks.



Sorry but my understanding was that &quot;Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP), Digest-AKAv2 (3GPP), Digest (CableLabs), SIP Digest (3GPP) and HTTP Digest (ETSI) are n. 5 different implementations of a &quot;HTTP digest&quot;-based IMS authentication&quot; whereas now it seems that at least the first one (i.e. Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP)) is the REAL IMS AKA.

If this is confirmed being the case, may I ask which is the difference between &quot;Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP)&quot; and &quot;Digest-AKAv2 (3GPP)&quot;, provided that are not completely different (despite their names).



Finally, I would like to provide you some information about 3GPP timing:

1.    the Common IMS process was decided for the Rel-8, that has been &quot;officially&quot; closed some months ago. Previously 3GPP IMS was intended for 3GPP users and then non-UICC based authentication mechanisms like SIP Digest and NASS bundled were completely out of the picture (and for 3GPP users they still are). In that scenario there was not the need to specify the &quot;coexistence mechanism&quot; as the only IMS authentication mechanism was supposed to be IMS AKA (a part from Early IMS, that was not normatively specified, as a TR is NOT intended to be normative, but this is another story...)

2.    we cannot hope having a work standardized prior having decided that it needs to be standardized... Nor we can hope having implementations that are compliant with a standard that does not exist yet... The 3GPP releases are going to be shorter and shorter, for instance the Rel-9 will take about one year, as far as I understood. In my view this means that works are done quite quicky, personally I would even say &quot;sometimes TOO MUCH QUICKLY to get something stable to be readily implemented&quot;, but works have to be decided, prior being included in a release and up to Rel-8 this was NOT the case for Common IMS. Can you see my point?

3.    The working Group specifying TS 33.203 usually meet 5 times per year, so we cannot hope having the work done &quot;in one month&quot; (except if it is done in &quot;one shot&quot; with all people happy about the very first proposal on the table (and let me say that this fabulous scenario is quite rare, as far as I saw.... ;o)))



Regards,

Mauro

Hello Mauro,



thanks for starting this discussion. Here some quick remarks from my

side:

It does ! Yet, it is labeled &quot;Digest-AKAv1&quot;. We tested this stuff

successfully with UICCs.

&gt;<i>

&gt;<i> 2.   The &quot;coexistence&quot; mechanism described within the Annex P of TS

Nope, it isn't (yet ?). After waiting for some years on this part of the

spec and then being pointed there, I can say: finally !



Thanks for this pointer and discussion and we shall look to improve the

Open IMS Core sooner or later (maybe with some funding from a telco out

there interested :-D )



Regards,



Peter
