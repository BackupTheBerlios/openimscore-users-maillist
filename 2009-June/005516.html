Oggetto: Re: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Basic question #2



Hi again,



no problem. We're recognizing that we're lacking the power to update our

website, so you are absolutely right. I hope at least that our

discussions would stay in Google's memory and help in the future.



1. NASS-Bundled is from TISPAN, so no, not 3GPP. We implemented it when

it appeared there... Is it now also in 3GPP?





[Mauro]: Due to the Common IMS process, since Rel-8 3GPP decided to include (see TS 33.203) NASS-Bundled as an IMS authentication option (beside IMS AKA, Early IMS and SIP digest). NASS Bundled is not intended to be used by 3GPP users (and basically it has been introduced, like SIP digest, to accommodate TISPAN needs) however currently it is documented within 3GPP TS 33.203, in an appropriate Annex.



2. We started way before Common-IMS. Then really, we got bored waiting

for them to converge. Now I am a bit confused about this convergence -

there's yet another MD5 - I think that they like to play with the

developer's time. And even if they'd drop some, we won't, cause we'll

break backwards compatibility.



3. v2 is better from a security point of view. It's basically some

better way to derive some keys at the end of the procedures. I ain't a

security guru, so it would be better if you look at RFC4169 (v2) which

highlights exactly the differences from RFC3310 (v1).



[Mauro]: Since 3GPP is supposed to be the only reference for the IMS standard (at least for 3GPP, TISPAN, CableLabs and 3GPP2) and since TS 33.203 has an explicit reference to IETF RFC 3310, I am afraid that the only Digest-AKAvx (3GPP) that makes sense to consider is the &quot;v1&quot;, even if &quot; v2 is better from a security point of view&quot;. This if the intention is to try to be aligned with the IMS standard, of course, but my understanding was that OpenIMSCore is willing to be an implementation of the existing IMS standard.



4. The difference is in who specified it, so who gets to claim the

vendor id (which is quite a stupid thing, but hey, let's not discuss

standardization). So the 3GPP one is the new one that just appeared in

R8, while the ETSI one is the one from the ETSI/TISPAN specs. Now I am

guessing that they are the same...



[Mauro]: I really hope that they are the same, however since I would like to start from what is supposed to be &quot;standard&quot;, to be on the safe side I will consider the &quot;SIP Digest (3GPP)&quot;. This because 3GPP accepted to become the ONLY standard on IMS and to accommodate the needs coming from TISPAN, CableLabs and 3GPP2 (plus possible others if and when they will decide to ask, in the future...)



yet I don't think that removing it is

a good idea. There might be some HSS implementations out there which

would be implemented in that standardization gap, so we'd break

compatibility. And well, the huge number of options should remain as a

proof of what parallel standardization does :-p.





5. With so many schemes in parallel and also from personal experience, I

think that coexistence is quite hard and even impossible with just one

S-CSCF doing all in parallel. Not to mention auto-detection. Well we

tried our best and I also studied the problem in the past but for some

it's impossible to decide which one can the client take, so that is why

we added in the HSS a &quot;preferred&quot; option per user. If you are interested

in opening the discussion on coexistence, with all the last updates,

just let me know.

And supporting additional (or legacy if you want) schemes I see more as

a step forward towards coexistence and not back.



[Mauro]: My (wrong??) understanding was that OpenIMScore is willing to be an implementation of what the standard says about IMS and the standardization body in charge of IMS is 3GPP. More in detail, 3GPP (Rel-8) tried to limit the list of possible IMS authentication schemes to the following n.4 main alternatives: IMS AKA, Early IMS (now called GIBA), SIP Digest and NASS-Bundled. Moreover, 3GPP also made the effort to specify (see TS 33.203 Rel-8, Annex P) how these n.4 IMS authentication mechanism can coexist and it has been quite a nightmare to find out the way to make them coexisting (at least on the paper...). Now, since the list of possible IMS authentication schemes of OpenIMScore is longer (and then different) than the one considered by the 3GPP standard, I am really wondering how could OpenIMScore benefit of the existing TS 33.203 Annex P (I mean the &quot;coexistance&quot; Annex). Can you see my point?

Based on your answers, I understand that Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP), Digest-AKAv2 (3GPP), Digest (CableLabs), SIP Digest (3GPP) and HTTP Digest (ETSI) are n. 5 different implementations of a &quot;HTTP digest&quot;-based IMS authentication, but that at least &quot;SIP Digest (3GPP)&quot; is the one described within TS 33.203. Correct?

Moreover, I assume that the &quot;Early-IMS (3GPP)&quot; implemented by the OpenIMSCore is compliant with what was originally described in 3GPP TR 33.978 (because now also Early IMS has been included in the TS 33.203). Is this correct?

Finally, provided that NASS bundled (ETSI) is aligned with what has been included in TS 33.203 for what concerns NASS-bundled (as I hope), I am wondering if OpenIMSCore implements also the IMS AKA or not... I mean the IMS authentication mechanism that at the very beginning of IMS was assumed to be the ONLY IMS authentication mechanism to be used.... Do you have any view on this? (for &quot;Digest-MD5 (FOKUS), please see below)&quot;.





(6). BTW - the FOKUS MD5 is actually AKA-MD5 without the AKA part. It

really was just 3-4 lines of code to add it. And it works like others,

just that it can be argued that it is marginally insecure. So I find

quite amusing (if not tragic) that the standardization bodies needed 3

tries to put in something that was actually there. And if you don't like

the hack, then anyway, RFC4740 specified this the first it seems.

[Mauro]: Forgive me, but I really do not understand what Digest-MD5 (Fokus) is for. Is does it relate to the 3GPP standard? (that is supposed to be the ONLY reference for IMS). I could be wrong, but I suspect that is NOT intended to be the FOKUS implementation of the IMS AKA described by 3GPP standard.

Correct?



You see, we don't want to take sides for the standardization bodies,

because all have their issues/bias and anyway, our targets are to

provide to the community a way to test the technology, not to lock

people into what some segment of the involved organizations have on

their agenda at the top. Then we'll always have only what is useful,

make sense, but not what some standard says, because we don't have

resources to spend on useless features, but every feature is implemented

from a requirement. If the requirement meets the standard it is great,

but it can be otherwise. So many things are missing and many are not

aligned with specs, but I hope that at the end of the day, anyone can

use the parts that they are interested in, while also not splitting the

benefits of a larger community.

[Mauro]: I really do not want to defend the standard and I agree that sometimes Companies primarily try to get what they want from it, however I believe that the standard is the only &quot;common ground&quot; that all the players might have, at least as a starting point, to perform whatever test. In my view, the role of the standard is even more important than ususal for IMS, where the COMMON IMS process has been agreed (and this has been the first case, as far as I rememeber). 3GPP tried to take in the needs of TISPAN, CableLabs and 3GPP2. Other parties have not been taken into account since they did not put forward their needs, at least as far as I know.







Cheers,

-Dragos
