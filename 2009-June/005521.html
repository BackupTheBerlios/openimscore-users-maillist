<PRE>Dear Dragos,

please note that I did not want to propose to remove anything from the website, but that the rationale behind my questions was just to understand how the OpenIMScore relates with the ONLY standard officially existing (at least for 3GPP, 3GPP2, TISPAN and CableLabs) nowadays on IMS, that is 3GPP.



To me, particularly in an environment like IMS, where multiple parties seem to be interested in, the compliance to the standard seems to be the only way forward, however this is only my personal view. I am not representing the 3GPP standard, of course: I just attend 3GPP and this is why I know how difficult has been the Common IMS process, that implies the satisfation of several competing needs on a sistem (IMS) that suddenly, after years on &quot;independent life&quot; was supposed to become COMMON... It has been very difficul also because TS 33.203 was originally written having 3GPP-only needs and requirements in mind, that means, for instance, users with a UICC, whereas TISPAN (just to give an example) is reluctant to adopt the UICC (that is the &quot;smartcard&quot;).

The Common IMS process (started within the 3GPP Rel-8) was decided to accommodate the IMS needs coming from various players and as it has be a real nightmare to specify, now I hope it will be helpful for the implementors...  ;o))



If IMS authentication mechanisms other than those considered by TS 33.203 Rel-8 are left in the OpenIMSCore website it could be fine, I guess, however I cannot figure out how they will be handled IN PRACTICE by the &quot;coexistence mechanism&quot; described within the Annex P of TS 33.203 Rel-8, provided that the coexistance mechanism will be implemented in the future by the OpenIMCcore website.

In my view the standard can be used as a guideline as long as you comply with it, but if you start deviating (e.g. adding options that might be absolutely reasonable but that are not foreseen by the standard), then there is the chance that you cannot rely anymore on the conclusions/guidelines written in the standard (in my view, as a minimum you have to doublecheck everything, as you never know, that means wasting all the efforts done to write the standard...).



However, to sum up the conclusions of our discussion:

1.    OpenIMSCore implements a set of possible IMS authentication mechanism that goes beyond the list considered by 3GPP TS 33.203. However the IMS authentication mechanisms considered by TS 33.203 Rel-8 should be implemented by OpenIMSCore. More in detail:

a.    The mechanism called &quot;SIP Digest (3GPP)&quot; in the OpenIMSCore is supposed to be compliant with the &quot;SIP digest&quot; considered by TS 33.203.

b.    The mechanism called &quot;NASS Bundled (ETSI)&quot; in the OpenIMSCore should be the implementation of the &quot;NASS Bundled&quot; considered by TS 33.203.

c.    The mechanism called &quot;Early-IMS (3GPP)&quot; in the OpenIMSCore should be the implementation of the &quot;Early IMS&quot; (now renamed &quot;GIBA&quot;) considered by TS 33.203.

d.    The IMS AKA mechanism specified by 3GPP since its Rel-5 IS IMPLEMENTED by the OpenIMSCore as &quot;3GPP Digest-AKAv1-MD5&quot;. However, could you kindly explain me why the HSS user interface does not show it beside the other implemented IMS authentication mechanisms?

2.    The &quot;coexistence&quot; mechanism described within the Annex P of TS 33.203 Rel-8 is NOT implemented yet by the OpenIMSCore.



Can you agree on the above conclusions?

It has been a quite long discussion, however it has been very useful, at least for me.

Many Thanks again!



Best Regards.



Mauro

Aha, did not knew this. Probably there will be no difference here, or? I

wonder if they use the vendor-id from ETSI... if not, we'll need to do

some changes. You know, with ETSI/CableLabs/3GPP in parallel, you had to

support 3 different application/vendor-id tuples on the Cx interface in

order to do them all... Anyway I promise to read the last version as

soon as I'll find some free time ;-).

&gt;<i>
</I>
well... I think that having AKAv2 too won't hurt at all. Our target is

to experiment first of all and secondly I don't see this as affecting

compliance, although compliance is kind of not realistic on the current

financing that flows into the project. Also we have a sort of guideline

that any new feature (from the standard or not) should provide a disable

switch in case some functionality would be broken for anybody else using

the project.

&gt;<i>

I agree with you. Still, for a time, we'll keep all of them, especially

as the CableLabs and ETSI versions of MD5 were a bit different in

procedures.

&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> to be an implementation of what the standard says about IMS and the

</I>
&gt;<i> (Rel-8) tried to limit the list of possible IMS authentication schemes

&gt;<i> to the following n.4 main alternatives: IMS AKA, Early IMS (now called

&gt;<i> GIBA), SIP Digest and NASS-Bundled. Moreover, 3GPP also made the

&gt;<i> effort to specify (see TS 33.203 Rel-8, Annex P) how these n.4 IMS
</I>
&gt;<i> authentication mechanism can coexist and it has been quite a nightmare
</I>
&gt;<i> to find out the way to make them coexisting (at least on the paper...).
</I>
&gt;<i> Now, since the list of possible IMS authentication schemes of
</I>
&gt;<i> OpenIMScore is longer (and then different) than the one considered by
</I>
&gt;<i> the 3GPP standard, I am really wondering how could OpenIMScore benefit

&gt;<i> of the existing TS 33.203 Annex P (I mean the &quot;coexistance&quot; Annex).
</I>
&gt;<i> Can you see my point?/
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, we are willing, but we are not working like a normal equipment

manufacturer. I see the process as operators demanding first features

through standardization and then compliance from implementers when

buying the equipment. So then compliance in the sense that you put it

makes sense. But... we're financing this from R&amp;D work which sometimes

moves in front of the standards and sometimes does not care about them

as they are quite unstable or simply not relevant.



I think that coexistence could be achieved on the subset, without

removing anything, so I hope that you'd be able to test that and I also

hope that maybe someone would experiment with more and give feedback to

the standard on what is feasible and what not.

&gt;<i> /Based on your answers, I understand that Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP),

yes, correct. If there are any differences, probably there were some

improvements which of course we'd like to have in.

yes, although again I am not sure about compliance with the latest versions.

</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>
yes for NASS. AKAv1-MD5 as in 3GPP R5/6/7/etc was the first one

implemented by the OpenIMSCore. If AKAv2-MD5 is not in there then I

think that 3GPP is lagging behind and it should be. For Digest-MD5 I'll

try and explain better below.

&gt;<i> //

&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> /[Mauro]: Forgive me, but I really do not understand what Digest-MD5
</I>
&gt;<i> (Fokus) is for. Is does it relate to the 3GPP standard? (that is
</I>
&gt;<i> supposed to be the ONLY reference for IMS). I could be wrong, but I
</I>
&gt;<i> suspect that is NOT intended to be the FOKUS implementation of the IMS
</I>
&gt;<i> AKA described by 3GPP standard. /
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> /Correct?/
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>
3GPP Digest-AKAv1-MD5, Digest-AKAv1-MD5 and FOKUS Digest-MD5 are 3

different authentication methods, which share a lot of common code. We

implement all 3. The first one is what 3GPP had from the beginning, AKA,

while the last is the simplest solution to having MD5 authentication.

This and the P-CSCF capability of enforcing Service-Routes even if the

client did not supports it, makes it possible to use virtually any SIP

client with IMS. And I think this was one of the big positive steps that

we took forward.



Then we called it FOKUS as to not confuse people on where does it come

from or what to expect on the Cx interface. The functionality is sooo

simple in fact that I wonder how 3GPP missed the opportunity. So

Digest-AKAv1-MD5 is a mechanism through which the secret key is piped

through AKA to get a password for MD5, plus additional keying material

for other purposes. If you input directly the secret key as a password

for MD5, you get the classical Digest-MD5, which works with every SIP

client. Sure, you can't use IPsec any more on Gm because no other keys

are generated, it is inherently less secure and, even worse, the

password is transmitted in clear on the Cx interface (although this

should be IPsec protected), but it just made sense and it is also simple.



 From a UE perspective all these Digest-MD5 algorithms (FOKUS, ETSI,

CableLabs, 3GPP) are exactly the same and we just needed one to get past

the client issue. If we enforce all the stuff with &quot;MUST&quot; in the

standard, but none that make sense in reality, then think how hard it

would be to test some simple Presence Server let's say if you need: an

AKA client, a USIM/ISIM ready for it, a client supporting IPsec, a full

Diameter stack and so on. IMS is slow to get off the ground as it is, so

we're just trying to accelerate adoption.



Although I don't think that this is what you meant, if you're looking at

it as we should not call it Open IMS Core as IMS would be a kind of

trademark from 3GPP, which requires full compliance or nothing, we're

out of scope as we don't care about this kind in our R&amp;D targets and

we'd probably rather rename the project. We're not claiming any

compliance to any release, but just consider that we implemented the

core features from many of them.



&gt;<i> //
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> /[Mauro]: I really do not want to defend the standard and I agree that
</I>
&gt;<i> sometimes Companies primarily try to get what they want from it,
</I>
&gt;<i> however I believe that the standard is the only &quot;common ground&quot; that
</I>
&gt;<i> all the players might have, at least as a starting point, to perform
</I>
&gt;<i> whatever test. In my view, the role of the standard is even more
</I>
&gt;<i> important than ususal for IMS, where the COMMON IMS process has been
</I>
&gt;<i> agreed (and this has been the first case, as far as I rememeber). 3GPP
</I>
&gt;<i> tried to take in the needs of TISPAN, CableLabs and 3GPP2. Other
</I>
&gt;<i> parties have not been taken into account since they did not put
</I>
&gt;<i> forward their needs, at least as far as I know./
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree. We actually wanted this Common IMS so much as it is not funny

at all to follow 3-4 targets instead of just one. But it took quite long

for this to happen (years) and we don't think that we can afford it. If

IMS takes too long to get adopted, why bother and not just go directly

to the Next-NGN? I don't want to go now into some long discussion about

why IMS is not there yet and how successful is the Internet at killing

the telephone business, but I think that as a R&amp;D and technology trial

project, we should accept any potential improvements which are in scope,

regardless if they come from an approved source or not. We're trying to

achieve some meaningful merge between the Internet and the telecom, so I

think that we have to adapt the telecom ways of standards and components

to the Internet one and be much more open.



Then we'd, of course, like to have our project compliant to the

standards, especially as it's a great independent tool for testing and

we're open to any proposals and ideas. But when confronting the involved

organizations and companies with proposals to move towards this goal,

unfortunately many think that open-source==free (and expect it to just

write itself) and many don't think that they should be the ones to pay

for this.



And it is a pity, especially as we already evaluated this coexistence,

with practical trials, some years ago (Florin Popescu, who was one of

the students that I guided, implemented the NASS-bundled, MD5 from ETSI

and from CableLabs and then tried them together with the AKA and

Early-IMS looking for the most simple configuration in his diploma

thesis). And then we dropped it because nobody really cared about

financing such a thing or the results. And now it seems that 3GPP has

re-done it through a theoretical evaluation, which I doubt that was

cheaper, faster or better.



So, please don't take any comments personally as a critique or anything.

I don't consider you as representing the standardization bodies, or

anybody else, but as a partner in our project (you just contributed by

telling us about the state of Common IMS). I might be wrong in my

opinions, or maybe I am biasing the project with my view, so don't

hesitate to correct me.





Cheers,

-Dragos
