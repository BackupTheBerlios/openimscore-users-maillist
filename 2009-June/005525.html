<PRE>Hi Mauro,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I see the advantages of AKA over just MD5, but I understand the 
reluctance. Why have such a high entrance threshold for doing anything 
with IMS, especially in our experimentation targets? Sure, you can do 
AKA in software, but this should be discouraged as it practically kills 
the AKA purpose.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Common IMS process (started within the 3GPP Rel-8) was decided to 
</I>&gt;<i> accommodate the IMS needs coming from various players and as it has be 
</I>&gt;<i> a real nightmare to specify, now I hope it will be helpful for the 
</I>&gt;<i> implementors... ;o))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I hope too. But I also hope that it is backwards compatible and easy to 
extend to. So this might mean a +4 new methods in the worst case. 
Otherwise it will be a nightmare to implement and support. And unlike 
the standardization bodies, we can't just ignore for example Rel.6 
compatible components.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If IMS authentication mechanisms other than those considered by TS 
</I>&gt;<i> 33.203 Rel-8 are left in the OpenIMSCore website it could be fine, I 
</I>&gt;<i> guess, however I cannot figure out how they will be handled IN 
</I>&gt;<i> PRACTICE by the &quot;coexistence mechanism&quot; described within the Annex P 
</I>&gt;<i> of TS 33.203 Rel-8, provided that the coexistance mechanism will be 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in the future by the OpenIMCcore website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I see it as working for a subset. Maybe we'll just mark somehow the 
coexisting ones in the web interface. Anyway, I would be against 
limiting the Open IMS Core functionality to what the standards say. It 
is a good idea that the default configuration would use the standard 
recommended ones, but I believe that our users should have the choice.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my view the standard can be used as a guideline as long as you 
</I>&gt;<i> comply with it, but if you start deviating (e.g. adding options that 
</I>&gt;<i> might be absolutely reasonable but that are not foreseen by the 
</I>&gt;<i> standard), then there is the chance that you cannot rely anymore on 
</I>&gt;<i> the conclusions/guidelines written in the standard (in my view, as a 
</I>&gt;<i> minimum you have to doublecheck everything, as you never know, that 
</I>&gt;<i> means wasting all the efforts done to write the standard&#8230;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>true... yet I would rather let the others in. I hope that this way 
someone would figure out new solutions and try them, then improve the 
standards.

And anyway, is coexistence such a critical item? Maybe some new users 
would want to make authorizations based entirely on PKI and TLS (or 
whatever). I don't think that we should deny them the chance of 
configuring a particular S-CSCF.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, to sum up the conclusions of our discussion:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. OpenIMSCore implements a set of possible IMS authentication 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism that goes beyond the list considered by 3GPP TS 33.203. 
</I>&gt;<i> However the IMS authentication mechanisms considered by TS 33.203 
</I>&gt;<i> Rel-8 should be implemented by OpenIMSCore. More in detail:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I would formulate as: the new Rel.8 recommendations (which appear since 
8.?.?) need to be re-checked and adapted if required.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a. The mechanism called &#8220;*SIP Digest (3GPP)*&#8221; in the OpenIMSCore is 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to be compliant with the &#8220;SIP digest&#8221; considered by TS 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>yes
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b. The mechanism called &#8220;*NASS Bundled (ETSI)*&#8221; in the OpenIMSCore 
</I>&gt;<i> should be the implementation of the &#8220;NASS Bundled&#8221; considered by TS 
</I>&gt;<i> 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>is the one from TS183.033. it needs to be checked if the 3GPP version is 
different and in the case it is, the old functionality should be first 
duplicated and then aligned with 3GPP
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *c. *The mechanism called &#8220;*Early-IMS **(3GPP)*&#8221; in the OpenIMSCore 
</I>&gt;<i> should be the implementation of the &#8220;Early IMS&#8221; (now renamed &#8220;GIBA&#8221;) 
</I>&gt;<i> considered by TS 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>it needs to be checked and aligned
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *d. *The IMS AKA mechanism specified by 3GPP since its Rel-5 IS 
</I>&gt;<i> IMPLEMENTED by the OpenIMSCore as &#8220;*3GPP Digest-AKAv1-MD5*&#8221;. *However, 
</I>&gt;<i> could you kindly explain me why the HSS user interface does not show 
</I>&gt;<i> it beside the other implemented IMS authentication mechanisms?
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>it is and it is called Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP). The MD5 is missing because 
3GPP did not specify any alternative to MD5. Also this might have 
already been aligned to R6, 7 and even early R8.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The &#8220;coexistence&#8221; mechanism described within the Annex P of TS 
</I>&gt;<i> 33.203 Rel-8 is NOT implemented yet by the OpenIMSCore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>nope, not yet.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has been a quite long discussion, however it has been very useful, 
</I>&gt;<i> at least for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>also for us!

Cheers,
-Dragos
