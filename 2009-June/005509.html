<PRE>Hi again,

no problem. We're recognizing that we're lacking the power to update our 
website, so you are absolutely right. I hope at least that our 
discussions would stay in Google's memory and help in the future.

1. NASS-Bundled is from TISPAN, so no, not 3GPP. We implemented it when 
it appeared there... Is it now also in 3GPP?
2. We started way before Common-IMS. Then really, we got bored waiting 
for them to converge. Now I am a bit confused about this convergence - 
there's yet another MD5 - I think that they like to play with the 
developer's time. And even if they'd drop some, we won't, cause we'll 
break backwards compatibility.
3. v2 is better from a security point of view. It's basically some 
better way to derive some keys at the end of the procedures. I ain't a 
security guru, so it would be better if you look at RFC4169 (v2) which 
highlights exactly the differences from RFC3310 (v1).
4. The difference is in who specified it, so who gets to claim the 
vendor id (which is quite a stupid thing, but hey, let's not discuss 
standardization). So the 3GPP one is the new one that just appeared in 
R8, while the ETSI one is the one from the ETSI/TISPAN specs. Now I am 
guessing that they are the same... yet I don't think that removing it is 
a good idea. There might be some HSS implementations out there which 
would be implemented in that standardization gap, so we'd break 
compatibility. And well, the huge number of options should remain as a 
proof of what parallel standardization does :-p.
5. With so many schemes in parallel and also from personal experience, I 
think that coexistence is quite hard and even impossible with just one 
S-CSCF doing all in parallel. Not to mention auto-detection. Well we 
tried our best and I also studied the problem in the past but for some 
it's impossible to decide which one can the client take, so that is why 
we added in the HSS a &quot;preferred&quot; option per user. If you are interested 
in opening the discussion on coexistence, with all the last updates, 
just let me know.
And supporting additional (or legacy if you want) schemes I see more as 
a step forward towards coexistence and not back.

(6). BTW - the FOKUS MD5 is actually AKA-MD5 without the AKA part. It 
really was just 3-4 lines of code to add it. And it works like others, 
just that it can be argued that it is marginally insecure. So I find 
quite amusing (if not tragic) that the standardization bodies needed 3 
tries to put in something that was actually there. And if you don't like 
the hack, then anyway, RFC4740 specified this the first it seems.

You see, we don't want to take sides for the standardization bodies, 
because all have their issues/bias and anyway, our targets are to 
provide to the community a way to test the technology, not to lock 
people into what some segment of the involved organizations have on 
their agenda at the top. Then we'll always have only what is useful, 
make sense, but not what some standard says, because we don't have 
resources to spend on useless features, but every feature is implemented 
from a requirement. If the requirement meets the standard it is great, 
but it can be otherwise. So many things are missing and many are not 
aligned with specs, but I hope that at the end of the day, anyone can 
use the parts that they are interested in, while also not splitting the 
benefits of a larger community.


Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks in advance for possible replies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For each individual user, the HSS allows /hssAdmin /to select one or 
</I>&gt;<i> more (up to &#8220;all&#8221;) IMS Authentication Schemes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP)
</I>&gt;<i>     * Digest-AKAv2 (3GPP)
</I>&gt;<i>     * Digest-MD5 (FOKUS)
</I>&gt;<i>     * Digest (CableLabs)
</I>&gt;<i>     * SIP Digest (3GPP)
</I>&gt;<i>     * HTTP Digest (ETSI)
</I>&gt;<i>     * Early-IMS (3GPP)
</I>&gt;<i>     * NASS Bundled (ETSI),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          1. Since several IMS Authentication Mechanisms listed above
</I>&gt;<i>             have been introduced in the 3GPP standard from Rel-8
</I>&gt;<i>             onwards, whereas
</I>&gt;<i>             <A HREF="http://163.162.61.160:8080/hss.web.console/index.jsp">http://163.162.61.160:8080/hss.web.console/index.jsp</A> says
</I>&gt;<i>             /FHoSS - The FOKUS Home Subscriber Server (/*/Rel. 7/*/)/,
</I>&gt;<i>             I assume that this Rel-7 is NOT intended to be the &#8220;3GPP
</I>&gt;<i>             Release&#8221; (for instance because NAS Bundled was not
</I>&gt;<i>             inlcuded in the IMS 3GPP Rel-7). Is my assumption correct?
</I>&gt;<i>          2. A part from Early-IMS and NASS Bundled, I cannot map the
</I>&gt;<i>             other IMS authentication schemes listed above with those
</I>&gt;<i>             specified within 3GPP TS 33.203 (and thanks to the &#8220;Common
</I>&gt;<i>             IMS&#8221; process, 3GPP tooks the whole responsibility of
</I>&gt;<i>             specifying IMS). For instance, among the n.8
</I>&gt;<i>             authentication schemes listed above, which one is supposed
</I>&gt;<i>             to be the &#8220;IMS AKA&#8221; (I mean the very first one IMS
</I>&gt;<i>             authentication scheme, specified since 3GPP Rel-5)?
</I>&gt;<i>          3. Which is the difference between Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP) and
</I>&gt;<i>             Digest-AKAv2 (3GPP)?
</I>&gt;<i>          4. Which is the difference between SIP Digest (3GPP) and HTTP
</I>&gt;<i>             Digest (ETSI)? Since 3GPP TS 33.203 does not contain both
</I>&gt;<i>             options, I am wondering why they are both considered by
</I>&gt;<i>             the openimscore.org implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>          5. Beside some individual IMS authentication schemes (i.e.
</I>&gt;<i>             IMS AKA, SIP Digest, NASS Bundled and Early IMS) TS 33.203
</I>&gt;<i>             Rel-8 (see Annex &#8220;P&#8221;) also specifies their &#8220;coexistance&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>             I am wondering if the TS 33.203 &#8220;Annex P&#8221; is already taken
</I>&gt;<i>             into account by the openimscore.org implementation or not.
</I>&gt;<i>             Since /hssAdmin/ is allowed to flag multiple IMS
</I>&gt;<i>             Authentication schemes, I would say that the &#8220;coexistance&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>             is already implemented, but since /hssAdmin/ is also
</I>&gt;<i>             allowed to flag IMS Authentication schemes that do not
</I>&gt;<i>             exist within TS 33.203 I would say that the &#8220;coexistance&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>             is NOT implemented yet&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for being so confused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks.
