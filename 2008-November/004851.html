<PRE>Hi Channa,

 

things are sometimes a bit complicated. 

 

Chapter 5.7.3 distinguishes between three different cases when an AS acts as
a originating UA

&#173;        When sending an initial request on behalf of a PSI that is hosted
by the AS, 


&#173;        When sending an initial request on behalf of a public user
identity, 


&#173;        When sending an initial request to a served public user identity, 


 

I now recognize that you are referring to the third case, and in this case
you are right. According to TS 24.229 you have two options for routing:

a)       Send the request to the I-CSCF (entry point of the network in case
of OpenIMSCore) without any Route header field and let the network care for
proper routing as in case of a terminating session.

b)       Send the request directly to the S-CSCF which cares for the
terminating UA. According to TS 24.229 you should add a Route header
pointing to the S-CSCF 
 without an &#147;orig&#148; parameter. (In my view you might
also omit the Route header when you send the request directly to the S-CSCF,
because that is superfluous if you directly address the S-CSCF). 

 

Now to your questions:

I assume that this behaviour is supported by OpenIMSCore. The easiest way to
verify it is to make a try. If there is an unexpected behaviour attach a
trace file and we can continue the discussion.

 

In neither case the S-CSCF uses different ports to distinguish between the
sources of a request.

 

Regards

Franz

Subject: Re: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Question: S-CSCF - AS interface issue

 

Hi Franz,

    I am refering the the following AS and S-CSCF requirement from
24.229-851 spec.

 

excerpt from spec 24.229-851:

5.7.3       Application Server (AS) acting as originating UA

====

When sending an initial request to a served public user identity, the AS
shall insert:

-    a Request-URI containing the served public user identity;

-    a P-Asserted-Identity as determined by the service logic (e.g. the URI
of the AS or the URI of the entity that triggered the SIP request, if the
sending of the initial request is triggered by a non-SIP request); and

-    a Route header pointing to the S-CSCF where the public user identity to
whom the request is generated is registered or hosted (unregistered case) or
to the entry point of the public user identity's network. The AS shall not
append the &quot;orig&quot; parameter to the URI in the topmost Route header.

NOTE 7:               The address of the S-CSCF can be obtained either by
querying the HSS on the Sh interface or during third-party registration.

====

 

Questions:

-Does current openIMS S-CSCF support above the context requirement.

-If so how to get it use openIMS S-CSCF.

 

Thanks in Advance.

 

Regards

Channa

&gt;<i> Hi Channa,

&gt;<i>

&gt;<i> &gt; The I-CSCF interface is the entry point for the request(s) coming from
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;other&quot; networks right (i.e Visted IMS /i.e Non-IMS SIP networks).
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; In this context the AS is home IMS domain application server, which
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; directly talk on ISC interface with S-CSCF.
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> You have to distinguish the role of the AS in this case. Is it acting as
</I>an

&gt;<i> originating or terminating UA?
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> If it is acting as an originating UA it has to know which S-CSCF cares for
</I>
&gt;<i> the user. If it does not know the S-CSCF it can use the I-CSCF.
</I>
&gt;<i> If it knows the S-CSCF it may also send the request directly to the S-CSCF
</I>
&gt;<i> using a Route header field with an orig parameter.
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; Does any standard sepecfies that AS should use &quot;I-CSCF&quot; interface to
</I>send

&gt;<i> &gt; SIP Request Messages to S-CSCF?.
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> TS 24.229 &#167; 5.7.3 Note 6
</I>
&gt;<i> 
</I>
&gt;<i> As mentioned above: If the AS knows the S-CSCF it may also send the
</I>request

&gt;<i> directly to the S-CSCF using a Route header field with an orig parameter.
