&quot;auth&quot;and&quot;auth-int&quot; qop options?

Vavilapilli,

&gt;<i> The above section tells that UE shall add Authorization header in 
</I>&gt;<i> Refresh REGISTER with same nonce and response as last 
</I>&gt;<i> received/calculated values. Does this applicable even if 401 carries 
</I>&gt;<i> qop options as &quot;auth&quot; or &quot;auth-int&quot;?  RFC 2617 describes the usage of 
</I>&gt;<i> nonce-count in digest calculation and nonce-count has to be 
</I>&gt;<i> incremented every time UE uses the same nonce. In such scenario, won't
</I>
&gt;<i> the digest response value generated for Refresh REGISTER different 
</I>&gt;<i> from last calculated response value?
</I>
IMS always uses one-time nonce values and a refresh REGISTER is always
based on an new authentication vector.

Srikanth&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't quite get ur answer. When u said &quot;IMS uses
one-time nonce value&quot;, does that mean that P-CSCF adds
Authenitcation-Info header with next-nonce attribute for the UE to use
it in Refresh REGISTER? If then, why does 24.229 talks about using last
received nonce value and last calculated response values in Refresh
REGISTER?


&gt;<i> i) what does the phrase &quot;REGISTER request that does not contain a 
</I>&gt;<i> challenge response&quot; mean? Does it mean that 'Refresh REGISTER' in the 
</I>&gt;<i> above context?
</I>&gt;<i> Ii)Any specific reason on why the nonce and response directive to be 
</I>&gt;<i> empty in the case of SIP digest with/without TLS?
</I>
Yes of course. As a difference to the legacy application of the digest
algorithm in SIP, the authentication in IMS always requires in the first
REGISTER transaction the private User Identity and the realm to generate
an individual authentication vector. The empty nonce and response
directive is used to distinguish the first from the second REGISTER
transaction.

Srikanth&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely the nonce and response in the first
REGISTER transaction has to be empty. I don't deny it. But the above
phrase is copy/paste from 24.229 section talking about Refersh REGISTER.
My doubt is, why should the nonce and response should be empty in
Refresh REGISTER if the SIP Digest/with or without TLS is used as
Authentication mechanism? Why should the nonce and response should be
same last received/calculated value in Refresh REGISTER for IMS AKA
authentication mechanism? Hope u r clear with my question.

regards
Franz
