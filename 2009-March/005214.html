<PRE>Hi
 
I have a question on 3GPP 24.229 specification related to IMS AKA as a
security mechanism.. 
 
Document: 24229-851.doc

1)&quot;Section 5.1.1.4.2 IMS AKA as a security mechanism: On sending a
REGISTER request, as defined in subclause 5.1.1.4.1, the UE shall
additionally populate the header fields as follows:
a) an Authorization header, with:
	- the username directive set to the value of the private user
identity;
	- the realm directive, set to the value as received in the realm
directive in the WWW Authenticate header;
	- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of
the home network;
	- the nonce directive, set to last received nonce value; and
	- the response directive, set to the last calculated response
value;&quot;

The above section tells that UE shall add Authorization header in
Refresh REGISTER with same nonce and response as last
received/calculated values. Does this applicable even if 401 carries qop
options as &quot;auth&quot; or &quot;auth-int&quot;? RFC 2617 describes the usage of
nonce-count in digest calculation and nonce-count has to be incremented
every time UE uses the same nonce. In such scenario, won't the digest
response value generated for Refresh REGISTER different from last
calculated response value? 

2)&quot;Section 5.1.1.4.3 SIP digest without TLS as a security mechanism: On
sending a REGISTER request that does not contain a challenge response,
the UE shall additionally populate the header fields as follows:

a) an Authorization header as defined in RFC 2617 [21], including:
	- the username directive, set to the value of the private user
identity;
	- the realm directive, set to the domain name of the home
network;
	- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of
the home network;
	- the nonce directive, set to an empty value; and
	- the response directive, set to an empty value;&quot;

In the above section,
i) what does the phrase &quot;REGISTER request that does not contain a
challenge response&quot; mean? Does it mean that 'Refresh REGISTER' in the
above context?
Ii)Any specific reason on why the nonce and response directive to be
empty in the case of SIP digest with/without TLS?


Please help me to understand this mechanism.. Appreciate ur help in this
regard.
 
 
Regards
Srikanth
