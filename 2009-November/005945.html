<PRE>Hello all,

I have a presence server which is connected to the S-CSCF via ISC interface,
and also several SIP clients connected to the P-CSCF via Gm interface.

Now I am facing two similar problems regarding
SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY/PUBLISH as follows;
(I am sorry but I have not prepared wireshark logs yet, so I will
attach them later.)

a) A SIP client performs initial registration procedure (REG-401 and
REG-200 transactions), and it succeeds.
Then the client generates and sends a PUBLISH request, which contains
XML presence data, to the P-CSCF.
This PUBLISH request is over 2KB, so the client sends it to the P-CSCF
over TCP, not UDP.
Upon receipt of it, P-CSCF forwards it to the S-CSCF over UDP, not TCP.
I have not confirmed yet but MTU between P-CSCF and S-CSCF may be enough large,
because the PUBLISH request is not fragmented on this forwarding.
The problem occurs at the next step.
The S-CSCF, upon receipt of the PUBLISH request from the P-CSCF, does
not react at all.
More concretely to say, not responding by any error/successful
responses, nor forwarding it to the presence server.
I have not confirmed whether the S-CSCF generated any error log or
not, but I will do soon.

b) A SIP client performs initial registration procedure (REG-401 and
REG-200 transactions), and it succeeds.
Then the client generates and sends a SUBSCRIBE request, whose Event
header field has &quot;presence&quot; event package,
to the P-CSCF.
Upon receipt of it, the P-CSCF forwards it to the S-CSCF.
In according to the iFC triggar point, the S-CSCF forwards it to the
presence server.
And 200 OK response is sent back from the presence server to the
client through the S-CSCF and the P-CSCF.
After that, the presence server generates and send the NOTIFY request,
which contains XML presence data, to the S-CSCF.
This NOTIFY request is over 2KB, so the presence server sends it to
the S-CSCF over TCP, not UDP.
Then, the problem occurs.
The S-CSCF, upon receipt of the NOTIFY request from the presence
server, does not react at all.
Not responding by any error/successful responses, nor forwarding it to
the P-CSCF.
I confirmied that the S-CSCF generated an error log &quot;tcp_read: buffer overrun&quot;.


I checked the openIMScore mailing list archives, and found the similar
discussions as above issue b.

- <A HREF="http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openimscore-users/2008-June/005533.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openimscore-users/2008-June/005533.html</A>

However I cannot find the solution for this issue b as of the moment,
nor the discussions regarding the issue a.

Is there anyone who knows anything about these issues?
Is there any upper limit of the SIP message size which the S-CSCF can
handle correctly?
If yes and it is the reason of above issues, how can I work around and
avoid them?

I would greatly appreciate if anyone could provide me some advise.

Best regards,

Ryota
