I learned that openimscore have a presence server .but when i use boghe client, if i use alice. add contact bob . i couldn't see the state of bob, but when i use wireshark it seems alice send subscribe(why subscribe herself ?) message to openimscore . openimscore send a notify , alice reply 200OK . then alice send many subscribe(alice at open-ims.test) and publish to the imscore. imscore send a subscribe to alice then alice send a 482 loop detected . imscore send a 408 request timeout . i don't know why it is like this . i think maybe i didn't do the right config in fhoss. anyone have use the presence service in openimscore? please give me a hand. thank you very much sorry for my poor english best regards. ozilpeng
