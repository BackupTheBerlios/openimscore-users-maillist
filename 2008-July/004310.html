<PRE>Again, as Franz said, our implementation is way older than the draft. And actually, it is inspired from an even older implementation of the nathelper module from SER.
 
The P-CSCF sends pings to clients that it things are behind NAT (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, etc). ping_all pings all the clients, to cover cases when you have NAT without the so called private IP address ranges.
 
Our implementation is NOT related to the draft that you indicate, so please do not compare it with that. We did not want to do that, but a server-side so to say based solution.
 
In your understanding of the draft, the P-CSCF sends just pongs and only at regular intervals, without influence from the client's pings.

Subject: Re: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Problem while using TCP transport


Hello Dragos,
 
Thanx for the clarification. I have a doubt regarding the current implementation. As you said Pings are sent by PCSCF to UE at regular interval. But as per &quot;draft-ietf-sip-outbound-14&quot; draft, Ping (CR LF CR LF) should be sent by UE and after receiving the Ping, server will respond through Pong (CR LF).
 
So in current implementation if user has ping=1 in the pcscf.cfg then PCSCF will wait for ping if received then send pong else do nothing.
 
Please correct me if i am wrong.
 
Regards,
Sabyasachi

	Hi Sabyasachi,
	
	Hmm... I don't know... I think that the server-side mechanism that we have now is better and lighter, cause you don't have to rely on the client. There are many clients out there and it's hard to require all of them to support this feature. We're rather going for an P-CSCF help&amp;enforce way. So, in no case we will replace completely the current feature that sends at regular intervals pings from the P-CSCF to the UE (you can though disable it from configuration as you wish). So far, together with the RTPProxy, we dodged quite well most of the NATs...
	
	If we'd see it as an extension, there's no downside to supporting this. Yet it is a little bit out of scope here as it should be implemented in the lower layers of SER (see iptel.org &lt;<A HREF="http://iptel.org/">http://iptel.org/</A>&gt;  for the underlying software for our CSCFs). So maybe a request there would be better targeted.
	
	In any case, we would gladly accept such help/patches even just here, as it is an obvious improvement. I for one though, realistically speaking, don't think that I have enough best-effort time slots in the next weeks to implement it myself.
	
	Cheers,
	-Dragos

		Thanks a lot Franz.
		
		Dragos, is there any plan for support Ping-Pong in Open IMS Core in near
		future? Kindly let me know if there is any plan.

				UE sends the Ping request but PCSCF does not reply with pong.
				     
				

			As I said: P-CSCF does not respond to pings (there is no pong). It only
			supports ping actively.
