<PRE>Hi,
 
&gt;<i> Your scenario was really clear (what tool did you use to do that?)!!!
</I> 
I have used the SIP Scenario Generator (<A HREF="http://www.iptel.org/~sipsc/">http://www.iptel.org/~sipsc/</A>).
Unfortunately this tool has some limitations and bugs.
A student from my class is actually working on a new tool to visualize the
SIP and Diameter flows. I hope it will be available soon.

&gt;<i> The additional digits you found were those which I pressed to test the
</I>&gt;<i> functionalities realizing the logic of the services for Asterisk;
</I>&gt;<i> regarding the QoS ... I think the cause are the codecs, should it be?
</I>
I do not understand the problem, because my experience with Asterisk is not
so deep. I wonder why Asterisk did not properly act on the received digits
as it received and acknowledged the digits in the INFO requests.  

&gt;<i> Actually I use UCT IMS Client over Ubuntu 7.10, have I to install specific
</I>&gt;<i> codecs to let the client work better?
</I>
I also do not understand why the RFC 2833 method is not used by UCT IMS
client (telephone-event codec) which is also supported by Asterisk according
to the SDP answer.

Maybe you should check that behaviour without IMS in between, and perhaps
also with other clients to identify the problem as a problem of Asterisk or
the UCT IMS client.

Regards
Franz
