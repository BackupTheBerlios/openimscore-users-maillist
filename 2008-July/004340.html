<PRE>Hi Renlei,
 
&gt;<i> I captured the trace and log, hope you could find some clues on my
</I>&gt;<i> problem. Thanks.
</I>
No. I could not. The traces (I am only interested in wireshark/tcpdump
traces as long as there is no obvious issue with one of the cscf) are too
weird. Maybe you can produce some clearer ones, starting e.g. logically with
registration.

Regards
Franz
