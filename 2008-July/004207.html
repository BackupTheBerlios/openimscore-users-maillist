<PRE>Hi Franz,

thank you for the tool suggested, it is really useful!

I tried to call services of other IVR than Asterisk and the quality is 
always the same. Than I'm trying to register with other SIP/IMS clients 
than UCT, but often it fails (with kapanga soft phone I succeded, but 
with others as Ekiga, failed). I think I have misunderstood 
something...could you suggest me any documentation other than FAQs? I 
would like to understand much more deeply Open IMS Core. In FAQs I 
learned only to configure few services superficially (I think), without 
understand (I think) the most of the features OpenIMS can cover. So if 
you can suggest links, tutorials, pdf documents ... I'll really 
appreciate it ! I found really few stuff over the network and only 
regarding IMS flows, not the Open IMS Core engine.

Thanks ... thousands thanks!

Marco

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your scenario was really clear (what tool did you use to do that?)!!!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> I have used the SIP Scenario Generator (<A HREF="http://www.iptel.org/~sipsc/">http://www.iptel.org/~sipsc/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately this tool has some limitations and bugs.
</I>&gt;<i> A student from my class is actually working on a new tool to visualize the
</I>&gt;<i> SIP and Diameter flows. I hope it will be available soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The additional digits you found were those which I pressed to test the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionalities realizing the logic of the services for Asterisk;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regarding the QoS ... I think the cause are the codecs, should it be?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not understand the problem, because my experience with Asterisk is not
</I>&gt;<i> so deep. I wonder why Asterisk did not properly act on the received digits
</I>&gt;<i> as it received and acknowledged the digits in the INFO requests.  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually I use UCT IMS Client over Ubuntu 7.10, have I to install specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> codecs to let the client work better?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also do not understand why the RFC 2833 method is not used by UCT IMS
</I>&gt;<i> client (telephone-event codec) which is also supported by Asterisk according
</I>&gt;<i> to the SDP answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe you should check that behaviour without IMS in between, and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> also with other clients to identify the problem as a problem of Asterisk or
</I>&gt;<i> the UCT IMS client.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Franz
