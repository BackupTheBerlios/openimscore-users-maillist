<PRE>Dear All,

Myself is Sougata from Barcelona. I am a PhD student attached with one
research group here working on IMS/NGN and other issues related to it.

I am writing this mail to have all of your thoughts on one issue which i
guess all of you will agree with me, which is the extreme complexity of IMS
architecture. Due to it's so high complexity level and high cost of
implementation, it's still not yet widely deployed.
Operators are still in ambiguity to go for full fledged implementation.

Amongst all the issues that are still yet to be resolved is the huge
signalling load which gets generated starting from one complete registration
to a complete call process. Due to the presence of so many network elements
starting from the 3 proxy servers to the various interfacing elements , with
each interface giving rise to one exchanged signalling message makes the
scenario more complicated.

My question in this scenario is, can this extreme complexity in it's present
architecture justify a new approach of re-designing IMS architecture
specially its core part? To make it more simple and cost effective?

What my thought on this matter is, amongst all the various elements the core
part can be made simple , i mean having 3 proxy servers is some how
unnecessary which gives rise to so many signalling messages , be it SIP or
DIAMATER. So instead of having a 3 Proxy Server based core, we can have a
much more simple core having maybe 1 or 2 proxy servers maximum along with
the SLF and HSS.

Would be eagerly waiting for any comments on this issue.

With regards ,

Sougata
