<PRE>Hi Sougata,

I can only speak for german mayor providers:
They are deploying it right now! Speaking for the german Telefonica
branch (other branches will follow), we will be migrating real
customers to our IMS platform in january next year! And i know other
mayor providers will do so as well (or they already did).
Unfortunately, i cannot tell you more without clarifying what i am
allowed to tell; however we have integrated some components into one
machine....

I think the problem for many providers are different at the moment:
- the current Open IMS-Core are not production ready, it is only
suitable for testbeds (you must pay a lot of $$$ to some vendor to get
a commercial solution). The Kamailio/SER project is quite mature,
definitely production ready; and if you only want voice, then this may
be totally fine for your needs...
- patent issues: Many aspects of an IMS world are covered by patents.
Probably some people are afraid of law-issues....

Kind regards,
Carsten

&gt;<i> Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Myself is Sougata from Barcelona. I am a PhD student attached with one
</I>&gt;<i> research group here working on IMS/NGN and other issues related to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am writing this mail to have all of your thoughts on one issue which i
</I>&gt;<i> guess all of you will agree with me, which is the extreme complexity of IMS
</I>&gt;<i> architecture. Due to it's so high complexity level and high cost of
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, it's still not yet widely deployed.
</I>&gt;<i> Operators are still in ambiguity to go for full fledged implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Amongst all the issues that are still yet to be resolved is the huge
</I>&gt;<i> signalling load which gets generated starting from one complete registration
</I>&gt;<i> to a complete call process. Due to the presence of so many network elements
</I>&gt;<i> starting from the 3 proxy servers to the various interfacing elements , with
</I>&gt;<i> each interface giving rise to one exchanged signalling message makes the
</I>&gt;<i> scenario more complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My question in this scenario is, can this extreme complexity in it's present
</I>&gt;<i> architecture justify a new approach of re-designing IMS architecture
</I>&gt;<i> specially its core part? To make it more simple and cost effective?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What my thought on this matter is, amongst all the various elements the core
</I>&gt;<i> part can be made simple , i mean having 3 proxy servers is some how
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary which gives rise to so many signalling messages , be it SIP or
</I>&gt;<i> DIAMATER. So instead of having a 3 Proxy Server based core, we can have a
</I>&gt;<i> much more simple core having maybe 1 or 2 proxy servers maximum along with
</I>&gt;<i> the SLF and HSS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would be eagerly waiting for any comments on this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With regards ,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sougata
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
