<PRE>Dear Sir ,

That means, current IMS architecture is going to be installed in without any
architectural change? For example in spain it's still lot of issues of
ambiguity of going for its full fledged implementation. I have talked with
some people from France Telecom and they say they are also not very sure for
going for it's full fledged implementation.

Now if German Operators are going for implementation , i guess this
signalling issues are like this as it is now. Keeping this point in mind , i
would like to know as a general query is that, regarding IMS what are the
hot topics which are bothering the industry as a whole? I mean , is it the
signalling related issues concerning its complex architecture or issues
related to IMS based various kind of next generation Value Added Services?
If anything else is going high also ? I would also like to get some thoughts
in this point is that , if a new less complex IMS architecture comes up with
less signalling related load will that make any positive impact on the
industry and research communities?

Regarding OpenIMSCore , well i guess it's still not fully 3GPP compliant, i
may be wrong also.

With Regards ,

Sougata

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Myself is Sougata from Barcelona. I am a PhD student attached with one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; research group here working on IMS/NGN and other issues related to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am writing this mail to have all of your thoughts on one issue which i
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess all of you will agree with me, which is the extreme complexity of
</I>&gt;<i> IMS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architecture. Due to it's so high complexity level and high cost of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation, it's still not yet widely deployed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Operators are still in ambiguity to go for full fledged implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Amongst all the issues that are still yet to be resolved is the huge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; signalling load which gets generated starting from one complete
</I>&gt;<i> registration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to a complete call process. Due to the presence of so many network
</I>&gt;<i> elements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; starting from the 3 proxy servers to the various interfacing elements ,
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each interface giving rise to one exchanged signalling message makes the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scenario more complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My question in this scenario is, can this extreme complexity in it's
</I>&gt;<i> present
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; architecture justify a new approach of re-designing IMS architecture
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specially its core part? To make it more simple and cost effective?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What my thought on this matter is, amongst all the various elements the
</I>&gt;<i> core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part can be made simple , i mean having 3 proxy servers is some how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unnecessary which gives rise to so many signalling messages , be it SIP
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DIAMATER. So instead of having a 3 Proxy Server based core, we can have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much more simple core having maybe 1 or 2 proxy servers maximum along
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the SLF and HSS.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would be eagerly waiting for any comments on this issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With regards ,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sougata
