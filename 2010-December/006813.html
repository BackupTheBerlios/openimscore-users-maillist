<PRE>Hi,

well we have some B2B-UAs acting as the P-CSCF (which are distributed
throughout germany). The clients register every 10 minutes or so at
P-CSCF, which will then itself register every 7 days or so at the
core. This reduces the traffic significantly.
While we are now only rebuilding the existing voice-infrastructure
with IMS, the idea behind it is definitely to add more
value-added-services to our network at a later stage.

Kind regards,
Carsten

&gt;<i> Dear Sir ,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That means, current IMS architecture is going to be installed in without any
</I>&gt;<i> architectural change? For example in spain it's still lot of issues of
</I>&gt;<i> ambiguity of going for its full fledged implementation. I have talked with
</I>&gt;<i> some people from France Telecom and they say they are also not very sure for
</I>&gt;<i> going for it's full fledged implementation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now if German Operators are going for implementation , i guess this
</I>&gt;<i> signalling issues are like this as it is now. Keeping this point in mind , i
</I>&gt;<i> would like to know as a general query is that, regarding IMS what are the
</I>&gt;<i> hot topics which are bothering the industry as a whole? I mean , is it the
</I>&gt;<i> signalling related issues concerning its complex architecture or issues
</I>&gt;<i> related to IMS based various kind of next generation Value Added Services?
</I>&gt;<i> If anything else is going high also ? I would also like to get some thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> in this point is that , if a new less complex IMS architecture comes up with
</I>&gt;<i> less signalling related load will that make any positive impact on the
</I>&gt;<i> industry and research communities?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding OpenIMSCore , well i guess it's still not fully 3GPP compliant, i
</I>&gt;<i> may be wrong also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With Regards ,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Sougata,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can only speak for german mayor providers:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They are deploying it right now! Speaking for the german Telefonica
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branch (other branches will follow), we will be migrating real
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> customers to our IMS platform in january next year! And i know other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mayor providers will do so as well (or they already did).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately, i cannot tell you more without clarifying what i am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowed to tell; however we have integrated some components into one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> machine....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think the problem for many providers are different at the moment:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - the current Open IMS-Core are not production ready, it is only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suitable for testbeds (you must pay a lot of $$$ to some vendor to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a commercial solution). The Kamailio/SER project is quite mature,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> definitely production ready; and if you only want voice, then this may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be totally fine for your needs...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - patent issues: Many aspects of an IMS world are covered by patents.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Probably some people are afraid of law-issues....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kind regards,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Dear All,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Myself is Sougata from Barcelona. I am a PhD student attached with one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; research group here working on IMS/NGN and other issues related to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I am writing this mail to have all of your thoughts on one issue which i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; guess all of you will agree with me, which is the extreme complexity of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; IMS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; architecture. Due to it's so high complexity level and high cost of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; implementation, it's still not yet widely deployed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Operators are still in ambiguity to go for full fledged implementation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Amongst all the issues that are still yet to be resolved is the huge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; signalling load which gets generated starting from one complete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; registration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to a complete call process. Due to the presence of so many network
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; elements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; starting from the 3 proxy servers to the various interfacing elements ,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; each interface giving rise to one exchanged signalling message makes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; scenario more complicated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; My question in this scenario is, can this extreme complexity in it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; present
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; architecture justify a new approach of re-designing IMS architecture
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; specially its core part? To make it more simple and cost effective?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; What my thought on this matter is, amongst all the various elements the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; part can be made simple , i mean having 3 proxy servers is some how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; unnecessary which gives rise to so many signalling messages , be it SIP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; DIAMATER. So instead of having a 3 Proxy Server based core, we can have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; much more simple core having maybe 1 or 2 proxy servers maximum along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the SLF and HSS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Would be eagerly waiting for any comments on this issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; With regards ,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sougata
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
