<PRE>Hello (again) Mauro,

due to the length of your post I feel forced to put the answers
inline ...

&gt;<i> Dear All,

</I>
Short answer: yes. Look in Milenage,java to see details.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2)   As MILENAGE allows some operator-specific customization, I was

</I>&gt;<i> implemented on the FOKUS HSS can be customized by the FOKUS&#8217;s user, to
</I>&gt;<i> align it to the MILENAGE set implemented in the UICC to be used for
</I>&gt;<i> test purposes. Do you have any information about this? 
</I>
Really good question. And yes: there is in hss.properties the option to
configure operatorId, AMF ID and Milenage parameters.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3)   Are the Quintets generated by the FOKUS HSS supposed to be used
</I>&gt;<i> also for the (needed) 3G AKA authentication to be performed before IMS
</I>&gt;<i> AKA (to authenticate the user to the PS domain)? 
</I>
(Unlike Telecom Italia) we do not have a 3G network to test with and
thus this was never done.

&gt;<i> In case, I assume that the FOKUS HSS is supposed to be able to &#8220;talk&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> also with the MSC/SGSN. Is this the case? I mean if the interfaces
</I>&gt;<i> towards the SGSNs/MSCs are supported, or not&#8230; 
</I>
I have hunch that those are SS7 based and thus not supported. We are
focused to support all-IP (read: Cx, Sh and Zh) interfaces in the FHoSS.
Maybe some more in the future.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4)   If quintets generated by the FOKUS HSS are intended to be used
</I>&gt;<i> ONLY for IMS AKA (i.e. they cannot be used for 3G AKA), in my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding it is like having a &#8220;duplication&#8221; of AuC functionalities
</I>&gt;<i> (since the AuC is certainly needed also for 3G AKA). In this scenario,
</I>&gt;<i> provided that it is the &#8220;right one&#8221;, I am wondering about how the
</I>&gt;<i> Quintets generated (for the same user) by the FOKUS HSS and by the
</I>&gt;<i> HLR/AuC can be kept &#8220;aligned&#8221;, to avoid syncronization failures due to
</I>&gt;<i> the SQN parameter (that is somehow &#8220;inside&#8221; the generic Quintet). By
</I>&gt;<i> chance, do you have any view on this? 
</I>
We have tested the synchronisation for IMS AKA only with real UICCs and
it works (this was already over 2 years back). As we tested in a private
WLAN for an access network there was no interference with 3G AKA syncing
but I see no reason why it should not work here as well.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If Quintets are NOT assumed to be generated in the FOKUS HSS(i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> FOKUS IMS does not implement any MILENAGE set), then I assume that
</I>&gt;<i> Quintets to be used (also) for IMS AKA have to be generated outside of
</I>&gt;<i> the FOKUS Core network, i.e. in the &#8220;real&#8221; HLR/AuC. This could
</I>&gt;<i> certainly be fine for quintets to be used for 3G AKA, but assuming to
</I>&gt;<i> use <A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/">http://www.openimscore.org/</A> to test IMS AKA, how can the S-CSCF
</I>&gt;<i> get the &#8220;Quintet&#8221; to be used for IMS AKA? 
</I>
Well, to complete the statements above: the FHoSS acts as AuC for IMS
registrations with AKA and sends the quintet to the S-CSCF in the MAA.

&gt;<i> Can the FOKUS S-CSCF fetch the Quintet from the &#8220;real&#8221; HLR/AuC located
</I>&gt;<i> outside of the FOKUS core network? Is the interface supported? 
</I>
Not as of now (unless there is now a Diameter interface for this). At
least this was never tried with us.

Hope this answered your question and we would appreciate feedback on how tests with UICCs went ;)

Regards,

Peter
