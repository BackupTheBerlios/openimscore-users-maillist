<PRE>Hi Mauro,

I agree with you on the standard and I know that it is hard. And also 
agree on the standard-compliance issue.

Yet... we have to keep in mind our targets and resources. We never 
wanted to be compliant or targeted this. Our budget is kind of nothing 
on one side and on the other we just want to offer to our users the 
required features so they could understand and align to the IMS 
architectures faster than waiting for fully compliant and commercially 
available core components.

At the beginning we at FOKUS had the initial targets of establishing a 
test-bed infrastructure which would allow us to trial IMS services and 
applications. Then we wanted to have some insight in the performance and 
feasibility of IMS as a platform. Lately, many have used it even on 
interop events because there was no other alternative probably as cheap, 
independent, open, configurable, etc. But up to a standard compliant or 
true-IMS-reference implementation, there is a long road. And in any 
case, I really don't think that this project would ever act as a direct 
revenue-producing equipment in any operator, but it would remain limited 
to the test-bed experimentation environment.

Much to our disappointment, the parties that are now benefiting the most 
from the fact that our project exists, still think that the Open IMS 
Core is disruptive for their way of business and do not give us any 
support. So although standard alignment would be good, I don't think 
that we'd ever get there either.

Oh and yes, I will RTFS :-p. Sorry for not doing it already. But I don't 
know that I for one can commit to any concrete fixes the next month, 
no-matter how small.

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the beginning TISPAn was willing to adopt the UICC for the IMS,

</I>&gt;<i> to the IMS AKA has been somehow added to the TS 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Initially they were documented as individual IMS authentication 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms, then we realized that the coexistance of all possible 
</I>&gt;<i> *standard* IMS Authentication mechanisms had to be guaranteed, in some 
</I>&gt;<i> way (and then the Annex P was specified, in the same Rel-8).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Referring to the backward compatibility issue, I guess that it can be 
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed as long as such a requirement is put forward by the 
</I>&gt;<i> interested parties&#8230; Providing backward compatibility against 
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary solutions or against solutions that 3GPP is not even aware 
</I>&gt;<i> of seems to be nearly impossible&#8230; Isn&#8217;t it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might be wrong, however in my view a solution that is not expected 
</I>&gt;<i> by a certain standard is proprietary, in respect of the same standard 
</I>&gt;<i> (then the same solution can be absolutely standard in another 
</I>&gt;<i> standardization body and maybe also for other purposes, but this is 
</I>&gt;<i> another story).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that I am not saying that a certain proprietary solution is bad, 
</I>&gt;<i> but only that is proprietary, at least in the context where it is 
</I>&gt;<i> used. As far as I understand OpenIMSCore aims to consider also 
</I>&gt;<i> possible proprietary solutions, if deemed useful/appropriate. If this 
</I>&gt;<i> is the case, I am fine about it (even if I am a little bit surprised 
</I>&gt;<i> because at the very end proprietary solutions might result being much 
</I>&gt;<i> more numerous than the ones agreed by a certain standard, that is 3GPP 
</I>&gt;<i> for IMS).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Referring to the possible improvements to the 3GPP standard, well, 
</I>&gt;<i> with n.4 (already!!) alternative IMS authentication mechanisms (PLUS 
</I>&gt;<i> one coexisting mechanism to allow them coexisting) I would hope to see 
</I>&gt;<i> something working in the field, prior suggesting possible 
</I>&gt;<i> improvements/enhancements&#8230;;o)))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my view to have something working IN PRACTICE, we need a stable 
</I>&gt;<i> standard, and Rel-8 has been finalized only some months ago&#8230;, so 
</I>&gt;<i> honestly I would be reluctant in suggesting whatsover improvement, at 
</I>&gt;<i> this stage&#8230; Maybe we need some corrections&#8230; ;o))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The coexistance is a critical issue in the sense that in a common IMS 
</I>&gt;<i> scenario there could be some users authenticating to a certain S-CSCF 
</I>&gt;<i> with SIP digest and others authenticating to the SAME S-CSCF with IMS 
</I>&gt;<i> AKA. Without the coexistance mechanism, how can the S-CSCF know how to 
</I>&gt;<i> behave in the various scenarios?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Referring to the fact that &#8220;/Maybe some new users would want to make 
</I>&gt;<i> authorizations based entirely on PKI and TLS (or whatever). I don't 
</I>&gt;<i> think that we should deny them the chance of configuring a particular 
</I>&gt;<i> S-CSCF/&#8221;&#8230;., well I am not saying that this is prevented by the 
</I>&gt;<i> standard 3GPP or that it has to be prevented, however a standard where 
</I>&gt;<i> everybody is allowed to do whatever he/she wants is not really a 
</I>&gt;<i> standard anymore, in my view. Rather, a standard should try to single 
</I>&gt;<i> out a set of possibilities that are perceived to cover all or most of 
</I>&gt;<i> the represented parties (of course parties that do not attend the 
</I>&gt;<i> meetings cannot pretend having their needs fully taken into account by 
</I>&gt;<i> the standard&#8230;.;o)))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, in general the latest version of TS 33.203 is available here: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/33203.htm">http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/33203.htm</A> (and the latest 
</I>&gt;<i> Rel-8 version is the 8.6.0 one.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whereas TISPAN (just to give an example) is reluctant to adopt the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see the advantages of AKA over just MD5, but I understand the

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AKA in software, but this should be discouraged as it practically kills
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the AKA purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Common IMS process (started within the 3GPP Rel-8) was decided to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accommodate the IMS needs coming from various players and as it has be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a real nightmare to specify, now I hope it will be helpful for the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementors... ;o))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope too. But I also hope that it is backwards compatible and easy to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> extend to. So this might mean a +4 new methods in the worst case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise it will be a nightmare to implement and support. And unlike
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the standardization bodies, we can't just ignore for example Rel.6
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> compatible components.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If IMS authentication mechanisms other than those considered by TS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 33.203 Rel-8 are left in the OpenIMSCore website it could be fine, I
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guess, however I cannot figure out how they will be handled IN
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PRACTICE by the &quot;coexistence mechanism&quot; described within the Annex P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of TS 33.203 Rel-8, provided that the coexistance mechanism will be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implemented in the future by the OpenIMCcore website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see it as working for a subset. Maybe we'll just mark somehow the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> coexisting ones in the web interface. Anyway, I would be against
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> limiting the Open IMS Core functionality to what the standards say. It
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is a good idea that the default configuration would use the standard
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> recommended ones, but I believe that our users should have the choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my view the standard can be used as a guideline as long as you
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comply with it, but if you start deviating (e.g. adding options that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might be absolutely reasonable but that are not foreseen by the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard), then there is the chance that you cannot rely anymore on
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the conclusions/guidelines written in the standard (in my view, as a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; minimum you have to doublecheck everything, as you never know, that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means wasting all the efforts done to write the standard&#8230;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> true... yet I would rather let the others in. I hope that this way
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> someone would figure out new solutions and try them, then improve the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> standards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And anyway, is coexistence such a critical item? Maybe some new users
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> would want to make authorizations based entirely on PKI and TLS (or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> whatever). I don't think that we should deny them the chance of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> configuring a particular S-CSCF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, to sum up the conclusions of our discussion:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. OpenIMSCore implements a set of possible IMS authentication
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism that goes beyond the list considered by 3GPP TS 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However the IMS authentication mechanisms considered by TS 33.203
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rel-8 should be implemented by OpenIMSCore. More in detail:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would formulate as: the new Rel.8 recommendations (which appear since
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8.?.?) need to be re-checked and adapted if required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a. The mechanism called &#8220;*SIP Digest (3GPP)*&#8221; in the OpenIMSCore is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supposed to be compliant with the &#8220;SIP digest&#8221; considered by TS 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; b. The mechanism called &#8220;*NASS Bundled (ETSI)*&#8221; in the OpenIMSCore
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be the implementation of the &#8220;NASS Bundled&#8221; considered by TS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is the one from TS183.033. it needs to be checked if the 3GPP version is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> different and in the case it is, the old functionality should be first
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> duplicated and then aligned with 3GPP
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *c. *The mechanism called &#8220;*Early-IMS **(3GPP)*&#8221; in the OpenIMSCore
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be the implementation of the &#8220;Early IMS&#8221; (now renamed &#8220;GIBA&#8221;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; considered by TS 33.203.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it needs to be checked and aligned
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *d. *The IMS AKA mechanism specified by 3GPP since its Rel-5 IS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMPLEMENTED by the OpenIMSCore as &#8220;*3GPP Digest-AKAv1-MD5*&#8221;. *However,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could you kindly explain me why the HSS user interface does not show
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it beside the other implemented IMS authentication mechanisms?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it is and it is called Digest-AKAv1 (3GPP). The MD5 is missing because
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3GPP did not specify any alternative to MD5. Also this might have
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> already been aligned to R6, 7 and even early R8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; **
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. The &#8220;coexistence&#8221; mechanism described within the Annex P of TS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 33.203 Rel-8 is NOT implemented yet by the OpenIMSCore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> nope, not yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It has been a quite long discussion, however it has been very useful,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> also for us!
</I>&gt;<i>
