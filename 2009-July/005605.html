<PRE>Dear All,



3GPP IMS AKA is based on &quot;quintets&quot; (i.e. the same kind of authentication vectors used for 3G AKA and 3G AKA is certainly needed to authenticate the user to the PS domain, prior accessing IMS).

But, where are supposed to be GENERATED the Quintets?



If Quintets are assumed to be generated in the FOKUS HSS:

1)    I assume that the FOKUS HSS has also AuC functionalities and, in particular, that it implements the MILENAGE algorithm (i.e the f1-f5 set described within TS 35.206). Is this the case?

2)    As MILENAGE allows some operator-specific customization, I was wondering about what customization (if any) have been implemented in the FOKUS HSS (as the same would have to performed on the UICC to be used for test purposes, otherwise the authentication will sistematically fail) or, viceversa,  if the MILENAGE algorithm implemented on the FOKUS HSS can be customized by the FOKUS's user, to align it to the MILENAGE set implemented in the UICC to be used for test purposes. Do you have any information about this?

3)    Are the Quintets generated by the FOKUS HSS supposed to be used also for the (needed) 3G AKA authentication to be performed before IMS AKA (to authenticate the user to the PS domain)? In case, I assume that the FOKUS HSS is supposed to be able to &quot;talk&quot; also with the MSC/SGSN. Is this the case? I mean if the interfaces towards the SGSNs/MSCs are supported, or not...

4)    If quintets generated by the FOKUS HSS are intended to be used ONLY for IMS AKA (i.e. they cannot be used for 3G AKA), in my understanding it is like having a &quot;duplication&quot; of AuC functionalities (since the AuC is certainly needed also for 3G AKA). In this scenario, provided that it is the &quot;right one&quot;, I am wondering about how the Quintets generated (for the same user) by the FOKUS HSS and by the HLR/AuC can be kept &quot;aligned&quot;, to avoid syncronization failures due to the SQN parameter (that is somehow &quot;inside&quot; the generic Quintet). By chance, do you have any view on this?



If Quintets are NOT assumed to be generated in the FOKUS HSS (i.e. FOKUS IMS does not implement any MILENAGE set), then I assume that Quintets to be used (also) for IMS AKA have to be generated outside of the FOKUS Core network, i.e. in the &quot;real&quot; HLR/AuC. This could certainly be fine for quintets to be used for 3G AKA, but assuming to use <A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/">http://www.openimscore.org/</A> to test IMS AKA, how can the S-CSCF get the &quot;Quintet&quot; to be used for IMS AKA? Can the FOKUS S-CSCF fetch the Quintet from the &quot;real&quot; HLR/AuC located outside of the FOKUS core network? Is the interface supported?



Sorry for this new basic question...

Many thanks in advance!

Mauro
