<PRE>Hello all,

I have some problems to interconnect OpenSIPS and OpenIMS.

My setup is a follow:

UA &lt;--&gt; HGW (embedded both OpenSIPS and NAT stuff) &lt;--&gt; P-CSCF (OpenIMS)

I used different UA (mainly Twinkle and X-Lite). The HGW (Home GateWay)
is running under OpenWRT on which I compile and install OpenSIPS. The
P-CSCF, S-CSCF and I-CSCF are all running on the same PC (standard
configuration from OpenIMS installation).

My OpenSIPS is just used to manage local message (perform some security
check) and manage the NAT/FireWall configuration of the HGW. So, from the
OpenIMS core point of view, is a transparent proxy.

My problem come from the fact that the P-CSCF (and subsequently the
S-CSCF) is registered my UA with its private @IP address and not the
public @IP address of the HGW. So, each time I sent a SIP message to the
IMS Core, the P-CSCF  reject my messages with a 403 &quot;Forbidden. You must
registered first in the P-CSCF&quot;. I understand that the P-CSCF check
who is sending the SIP message based on the source @IP. In my case, the
source @IP address is the public one (i.e. the HGW public one). However,
this public @IP address is not know by the P-CSCF i.e. it doesn't
correspond to a registered UA. So, Outgoing call are not working.
Fortunately, Incoming call (i.e. from a UA which is directly connected
to the IMS Core) are working well.

I try several configuration using nathelper module, but I just got a
negative reply from the S-CSCF instead of the P-CSCF (I.e. I pass the
P-CSCF checking by using force_rport in register and invite message)).

In twinkle, I also try to modify the IP address used for the Contact field.
I not used a STUN server, but simply configured by hand the public IP address
twinkle must used. I effectively saw registered message with appropriate
public IP address in the register message. But, I can't anymore make a
call: INVITE message are again block by the P-CSCF and I got a &quot;403&quot; reply.

The same UA behind the same HGW, but without opensips active, register
perfectly in openIMS and could make call without problem (except that the
FireWall on the HGW is not correctly open for media flows).

I make a capture with wireshark of both REGISTER &amp; INVITE sequences in
both case (with and without opensips). The only difference come from the
additional VIA and record_route inserted by the opensips.

Is somebody have already try to interconnect OpenSIPS with OpenIMS ? Is it
feasible ?

Thanks a lot for your help.

Olivier
