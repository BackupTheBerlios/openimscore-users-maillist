Hello Dragos,
Thanks for your reply.
I know of a few commercial CSCF products which support the ability to
configure &quot;Trusted servers&quot;. The S-CSCF routes any message which has
source and destination either a &quot;trusted server&quot; OR &quot;registered users&quot;.
This helps in scenario when AS needs to send an INVITE to any server (
say MRF), we would just need to add both AS and MRF to &quot;Trusted server&quot;.

Is there some such mechanism/plan to have such mechanism in s-cscf which
would allow AS to send INVITE to MRF, both being a &quot;trusted servers&quot; ?

Regards,
Gaurav

interaction

As you say, the AS needs to deal with it, so it is not something in the
core.

However, when you want to initiate a call from the AS, you have
basically 2 options:

1. Do origination - and as such, simulate a UE. Then you need to fill a
Route header as indicated in the 3rd party REGISTER that we do not have
yet. This is for now almost the same as the Route header from the
client.
2. Do termination - and send the request to the domain of the Req-URI -
that would get resolved into a I-CSCF.
