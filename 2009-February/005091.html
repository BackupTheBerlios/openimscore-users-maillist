<PRE>Hi Franz,

I am sending REFER within the INVITE dialog only.. but I want to have my AS to receive both INVITE and REFER messages..

As I can observe, in SCSCF, routing for the REFER method is being handled in orig_subsequent part only..

route[Orig_Subsequent]
{
        log(1,&quot;&gt;&gt;       Orig_Subsequent\n&quot;);
        :
        :
} 

&gt;<i>&quot;If you want to do some action on a REFER request within an INVITE initiated dialog you have to trigger on INVITE and pass-through alls other requests in your &gt;application except the REFER&quot;
</I>
But how can I forward it to the AS from SCSCF, without specifying iFC for REFER?? (sorry for my ignorance..I started with SER very recently! )
can I directly forward it using functions like t_relay()??

If the answer is too long, please let me know where can I find the related information..

Thankyou so much for your support !!! 

Regards,
Sireesha

  Hi Sireesha,


  &gt; I want to forward the &quot;REFER&quot; message to be sent to AS from SCSCF..


  I want to stress the fact that iFCs are only allowed to be used at &quot;initial&quot; SIP requests (see TS 23.218 6.2.9). 
  Initial SIP requests are dialog initiating requests or standalone requests (see the definition in TS 23.3218: Initial Request: a SIP request that either initiates the creation of a new dialog or is part of a standalone transaction.)

  REFER may be a standalone request or part of a dialog. In the latter case you are violating SIP standards when you modify the route during a dialog by setting a trigger on it.
  If you want to do some action on a REFER request within an INVITE initiated dialog you have to trigger on INVITE and pass-through alls other requests in your application except the REFER, where you act upon. This is because REFER within a dialog is not an initial SIP request.

  regards
  Franz
