<PRE>Hi Reza,

short answer - the two projects have different scopes. Yes, they use the 
same protocols, but for different purposes. Yes, you can do the same 
registration/calls, but that does not mean that they fulfill the same needs.

The Open IMS Core is a prototype implementation of the IP Multimedia 
Subsystem core components. And IMS is supposed to be the architecture of 
the Next Generation Networks, which tries to bring the IP world to the 
telecom business and as such replace the current telecom switches. And I 
am talking about the ones talking SS7, you know, the big guns, at 
operators, filling entire rooms and serving millions of users.

Asterisk then is a software PBX (IMHO.. the sales buys at the company 
behind it might tell you it is much more, of course). So I for one am 
thinking about a company telephony system, something handling let's say 
hundreds of connected telephones, but really not millions. And really 
not going to replace those big switches.

Then the Open IMS Core implements some standards (or at least goes in 
that direction), while Asterisk is a Swiss-army-knife without a standard 
to follow, just the functional requirements.

Then we only want to play with IMS, not make money by putting the Open 
IMS Core into commercial exploitation, while Asterisk clearly does that. 
The institute that I work for spawned before a commercial project, but 
it was a SIP proxy - www.iptel.org . We are using that base code, but 
for non-commercial purposes.

So there are different playgrounds here. To make things a bit more 
confusing, you can probably integrate Asterisk into an IMS core network, 
in order to add the services that Asterisk can provide.

Then if you talk about quality, you went a bit too far with the codecs. 
The Open IMS Core only cares and handles the signaling and not the 
media. That is end-to-end practically and does not depend on the 
signaling routers and processors, but just on the communication 
endpoints. So really we can't make any comparison here. Maybe if you 
would like to compare the delays of the SIP messages, but also then 
you're comparing apples to oranges.

So, each has its own purpose. For some examples, the Open IMS Core won't 
provide you with the IVR system, but integrating Asterisk into it would 
help you there. On the other side Asterisk won't be able to handle 
millions of users or deal with their security, QoS, all the 
authentications, service triggering a.s.o., because simply it does not 
have the architecture for that.

BTW: this is a good reference

</I>&gt;<i> I am getting more curious about this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So basically, i have managed to build a testbed for next generation in
</I>&gt;<i> IP Multimedia Subsystem using OpenIMSCore. Used the x-lite for the
</I>&gt;<i> client and managed to have a communication between client using
</I>&gt;<i> video.Meanwhile, I have also once built an asterisk testbed. Alse used
</I>&gt;<i> the x-lite for the client and managed to do a video communication.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I still in a doubt. So actually what is the actual benefit of
</I>&gt;<i> using the openimscore compared to asterisk ? they both can deliver
</I>&gt;<i> message, voice, and they both are capable of delivering videos
</I>&gt;<i> communication quite well. Based on the theory that I read, IMS used
</I>&gt;<i> AMR codec meanwhile the asterisk used g264, etc codec (cmiiw) and it
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to deliver a big differences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The point is that as a client, i somehow does not feel any big
</I>&gt;<i> differences between the quality of the communication, including the
</I>&gt;<i> delay, the bitrate that is transfered, etc. Where does actually the
</I>&gt;<i> codec act? Sp is the really differences between openimscore and
</I>&gt;<i> asterisk is only located at the access layer (ubiquitous access) and
</I>&gt;<i> the capability of integrating different kind of SIP AS, and no others?
</I>&gt;<i> (in practical ways,i mean from the client point of view)..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for sharing your knowledge guys, sorry if I have lot of
</I>&gt;<i> missing concepts  :),
