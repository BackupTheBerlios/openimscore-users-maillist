<PRE>hi all, I do not know whether this question  is appropriate to be
asked in this forum or not. But i am totally curious about this.
Perhaps those who are experienced so much in this field can share
their knowledge :)

Having read this blog :
<A HREF="http://sipstuff.blogspot.com/2007/02/competing-eco-systems-ims-ser-asterisk.html">http://sipstuff.blogspot.com/2007/02/competing-eco-systems-ims-ser-asterisk.html</A>
I am getting more curious about this.

So basically, i have managed to build a testbed for next generation in
IP Multimedia Subsystem using OpenIMSCore. Used the x-lite for the
client and managed to have a communication between client using
video.Meanwhile, I have also once built an asterisk testbed. Alse used
the x-lite for the client and managed to do a video communication.

However, I still in a doubt. So actually what is the actual benefit of
using the openimscore compared to asterisk ? they both can deliver
message, voice, and they both are capable of delivering videos
communication quite well. Based on the theory that I read, IMS used
AMR codec meanwhile the asterisk used g264, etc codec (cmiiw) and it
supposed to deliver a big differences.

The point is that as a client, i somehow does not feel any big
differences between the quality of the communication, including the
delay, the bitrate that is transfered, etc. Where does actually the
codec act? Sp is the really differences between openimscore and
asterisk is only located at the access layer (ubiquitous access) and
the capability of integrating different kind of SIP AS, and no others?
(in practical ways,i mean from the client point of view)..


Thank you for sharing your knowledge guys, sorry if I have lot of
missing concepts  :),




Regards,

Reza
