<PRE>Hi Franz,

Thankyou for quick reply!

As I understood from your statement of adding AS in the record-route, I have added record_route field with my AS address, when INVITE comes to my AS..
Is it correct?

when I have added AS in the record_route, I guess, some weird behaviour is observed..

as far as INVITE, 183 session in progress, 100 trying...flow seems to be ok (though message is being sent to SCSCF for couple of times..)

but for PRACK, ACK, REFER message which come after INVITE, they are going like:
    UE1 -&gt; PCSCF -&gt; SCSCF -&gt; AS -&gt; UE2 (message is being sent from AS to UE2 directly )
Is this correct??

Attached is the wireshark trace of the INVITE..

could you please help me in resolving this.

Regards,
Sireesha

  Hi Sireesha,


  &gt; But how can I forward it to the AS from SCSCF, without specifying iFC for REFER?? (sorry for my ignorance..I started with SER very recently! )
  &gt; can I directly forward it using functions like t_relay()??
   
  That is an easy question.

  You have to trigger on INVITE (dialog initiating request) and add a Record-Route header field with the address of your AS. Then you will automatically receive all messages of the dialog because the AS will be added to the route.

  regards
  Franz
