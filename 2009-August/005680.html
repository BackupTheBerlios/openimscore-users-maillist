<PRE>Hi,

I am pretty new to OpenIMSCore. The feature I am working on is to
integrate openIMS with an external voicemail platform.
The use case for this would be when a user (say alice) is busy on a call
the another user calling alice should be able to leave a voicemail and
this voicemail in turn would be stored on the voicemail server.
My question is what kind of changes do we require in OpenIMCore ( or we
need to look into any specific area) to redirect to voicemail server?

Any help in this regard is highly appreciated.

Thanks, 
Sachin
