<PRE>Hi all,

I am trying to check out the latest sources but I am getting the following 
error:

# svn checkout 
<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openimscore/ser_ims/trunk">http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/openimscore/ser_ims/trunk</A> ser_ims
svn: REPORT request failed on 
'/svnroot/repos/openimscore/!svn/vcc/default'
svn: REPORT of '/svnroot/repos/openimscore/!svn/vcc/default': 400 Bad 
Request (<A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de">http://svn.berlios.de</A>)

I also tried from another PC using Tortoise SVN and the same error 
occurred. Is something wrong? I had managed to check out previous versions 
of ser_ims a couple of months ago.

thanks
Josef
