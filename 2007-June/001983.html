<PRE>Hi all,

Is there any guide or tutorial anywhere available which describes how to 
configure an AS in HSS for the different scenarios (B2BUA, Terminating UA 
or Originating UA)? Unfortunately there is not much information on the 
openimscore website and it isnt too clear what needs to be in place 
(Filter Criteria, Trigger Points, AS). 

I know there is the default_as for presence pre-configured, but that just 
means one has to try to figure out the jigsaw puzzle and trying to 
replicate the same thing for your AS. Maybe an addition to the FAQs or 
Documentation section would be helpful for many people to understand how 
things work in a logical way. What do you think?

best regards,

Josef
