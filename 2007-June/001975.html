<PRE>Hi all,

If an AS acting as UA wants to start a call to a tel URI or to another
IMS domain, what should be the call flow?

We were testing by having the AS send the INVITE to the I-CSCF,
exactly the same as when the AS calls a SIP URI for an IMS user in our
network (and this latter case works). But when the AS calls a tel URI
which is NOT (implicitly) registered in the IMS core (e.g. a PSTN
number) or when the AS calls a SIP URI for another domain, the I-CSCF
currently runs route[Initial_Request] (no loose route), performs the
LIR and returns 600 &quot;Does not exist anywhere - HSS User Unknown&quot;.

We could make the AS send the request to any S-CSCF in the network,
but this would not work when the AS calls our IMS users if the wrong
S-CSCF is contacted. If the AS wants to call a user in our domain it
should send through the I-CSCF or use the Sh interface to determine
which S-CSCF to contact.

The question is: should the AS be responsible (using the Sh interface)
to check whether the destionation tel or sip URI is a user in this IMS
domain? Or should the I-CSCF be changed in order to forward the INVITE
after receiving DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN from the HSS
- to any S-CSCF when the Req-URI is a tel URI, so that the S-CSCF can
decide to send it to PSTN, according to specs;
- to the destination domain, if the Req-URI has a SIP URI for another domain.

I would prefer changing the I-CSCF.
What do you think? I can't find instructions in the specs for this case.

JF
