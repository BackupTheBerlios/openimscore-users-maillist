<PRE>Hi all,

I have managed to install the presence agent based on openser (as 
indicated here: <A HREF="http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/presence_server_howto.html">http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/presence_server_howto.html</A>)
however now I am observing that for some reason, most of the PUBLISH 
requests going out from one of my clients are not being successfully 
NOTIFYed to the other client.
It does occasionally work (generally after a restart although I havent 
managed to find out the pattern yet) so I dont think it is a networking or 
basic configuration issue. 

I increased the logging on openser, and noticed the following log each 
time I change the presence status of one of my clients:

0(15160) receive_msg: cleaning up
 0(15160) SIP Reply  (status):
 0(15160)  version: &lt;SIP/2.0&gt;
 0(15160)  status:  &lt;403&gt;
 0(15160)  reason:  &lt;Forbidden - Dialog not found on S-CSCF or Terminating 
user not suitable for unregistered services&gt;
 0(15160) parse_headers: flags=2

I suspect that this is related. Any idea what it means and how can I solve 
it?

thanks,

Josef
