<PRE>Hi Peter,

Thanks again for your quick reaction :)

I will contribute in the future (once I understand things better 
myself)...

regards,
Josef

AW: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Step by step guide for configuring an AS






Hi Josef,
 
seems like I was a little too vague in my quick post and so changed the 
corresponding FAQ section again &#8211; have a look.
For the &#8220;help&#8221; section on the web interface, I must say that we are always 
open for users that commit suggestions for an explaining text there. So 
feel invited to contribute ;)
In the coming version of FHoSS it so far planned to have a little more 
explanation but certainly not a fully maintained text look-up/help that 
avoids reading the specs after all.
Regards,
Peter

Betreff: Re: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Step by step guide for configuring an AS
 

Hi Peter, 

Thanks for your quick reply! 

This is my feedback: 

4. add the iFC to the user profile of the applicable users 

Are you referring to the Service Profile like default_sp? I found no 
reference to 'user profile' anywhere in the interface, except for the 
section on top. 

5. assign the user profile to the users 

I assume again that this is the service profile. Is it the part when one 
sets the Public Identity of the user? 

Having an entry in the FAQ is a good initiative. However, I think it would 
be also helpful to have a more detailed dedicated HTML document for this, 
maybe incorporated in the Help section (which now has a popup saying 'Try 
again later'), which explains what the options are. 

I think lots of people (especially those who havent read thoroughly 
through all the 3GPP specs) will have questions like mine such as: 
Does the option to configure the AS  'continued' or 'terminated' 
correspond to when your AS just needs to intercept traffic or act as a 
terminating/B2BUA respectively? 
What does the ConditionType CNF / DNF option mean? 
How does one associate an AS to a particular number/sip address? For 
instance an IVR / Voice mail service. Does it need to register as a normal 
UA only? 
What do all the parameters in the Private User Identity correspond to? 
Lets say one wishes to test with a sample ISIM card (when some devices 
using ISIM are out, hopefully), where does he put the keys of the user? 
What parameters have to be enabled and how does he go about configuring 
the right security parameters.
I think that having more comprehensive information centralised in one 
place will definitely help us make more effective use of the very precious 
work you are all doing there in our testbeds and experiments. 

thanks a lot for your support, 

Josef

Hi Josef,

I just created a new FAQ entry for the HSS. Let me know if that is
enough info for starters.

Regards,

Peter
