<PRE>Thanks for your answer.

One more thing I want to clarify: location data is not stored in HSS, right? So, for AS it is not possible to fetch the associations between AORs and UE locations from anywhere, the only thing that could be done is inspection of all REGISTER requests by AS, right?

Thanks,
Sergey.

By default it stores everything in memory, but you can enable (in the
configuration) persistency to files or database. For now it just dumps
all the memory contents to files or database every configurable
interval. No support yet for a &quot;caching mode&quot;, where the CSCFs would
hold in memory upto some amount of state (dumping to DB after a
configurable expiration time) and query the DB when needed.

&gt;<i>    Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could anyone tell me where S-CSCF stores associations between public
</I>&gt;<i> identities and real locations of users (those which are specified in Contact
</I>&gt;<i> header on the registration stage)? I looked at the source code and it seems
</I>&gt;<i> like S-CSCF holds everything in memory. Is that true? From IMS point of view
</I>&gt;<i> it is OK, as S-CSCF does not have to reveal this sort of information to any
</I>&gt;<i> other nodes, but nevertheless, storing anything of that volume (I can easily
</I>&gt;<i> imagine millions of simultaneously registered users in production
</I>&gt;<i> environment) in memory seems strange.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sergey.
