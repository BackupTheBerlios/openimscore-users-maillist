Thanks for the feedback.

You got it right, it's too complicated (to debug at least). I understand the point about B2BUA v Proxy but if you think about it a (Non IMS) SIP Proxy that can redirect would not terminate, but would re-write the Request URI and forward the message, so you would hope that would work here. Anyway that's a digression.

We realize that this scenario is probably too complex and we are revisiting. Thanks for helping making our decision easier!

I'll let you know how it works out.

Mark

 OpenIMSCore?

 Hi Mark,

 The ACK is a little strange... but so is the scenario :)...

 First thing... you say &quot;Origination trigger&quot;... yet I see the triggering
 happening on the terminating side...

 Then... I don't think that what you are trying would work. It seems that
 when your AS receives the 486, it just forks the old INVITE and carries
 on... on the same dialog.... sorry, but I never thought about this
 scenario and the new INVITE would be identified on the same dialog as
 the first one and that old one is being closed in parallel... I think
 that usually this scenario is best done with a B2BUA AS, which handles
 one dialog towards the originator and then one or more towards the
 terminating side...

 I am looking at the ACK there and can't figure out what is wrong... too
 complicated...

 One thing that would surely not work - your AS changes the terminating
 user on the terminating S-CSCF... this would mean that the specific
 S-CSCF would somehow have to move into an originating mode and then
 forward to the S-CSCF assigned to john? (you are lucky now that you have
 just one S-CSCF and everybody is there). This scenario is a little too
 awkward... I would go with a proper B2B UA that would not just proxy the
 message through, but do proper termination.


 Cheers,

 &gt; All
 &gt;
 &gt; We have an Application Server connected to the OIMSCore. The for
 &gt; example AS can perform a simple redirect on busy.
 &gt;
 &gt; AS Trigger is set up for Origination trigger only.
 &gt;
 &gt; In a test scenario we have three users registered, Alice, Kate and
 &gt; John. All use the Franhoffer IC Lite. See attached trace, Sip_scenario
 &gt; file and IMS logs
 &gt;
 &gt; Alice calls Kate, Kate rejects call with 486 Busy (after initial 180
 &gt; ringing).
 &gt;
 &gt; The AS on receipt of 486 sends INVITE to John.
 &gt;
 &gt; At this point things start to go wrong.
 &gt;
 &gt; Issue A
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;     * The P-CSCF sends retries/duplicates  of the 486 Busy to the
 &gt;       S-CSCF (even though the S-CSCF seems to correctly ACK the 486)
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;     * The S-CSCF sends  an extra ACK (with invalid branch values) to
 &gt;       the P-CSCF as a result of the AS sending an ACK to 486 from the AS
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;     * This activity repeats throughout the trace. Cannot find out why
 &gt;       from the logs.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Issue B
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;     * John Receives the INVITE and sends 180 and 200OK when he answers.
 &gt;     * Alice receives the 200OK and sends ACK to 200OK
 &gt;     * This ACK gets stuck at S-CSCF
 &gt;     * John never receives ACK so retries 200OK
 &gt;     * Alice gives up and sends BYE.
 &gt;     * Gets 403 Dialog not found. This is OK because the dialog is not
 &gt;       complete. But shouldn't this be a 481 Dialog not found??
 &gt;     * Cannot establish why Alice's 200OK get stuck at S-CSCF
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; In summary
 &gt;
 &gt; 1) At packet 1878 Kate sends a 486Busy
 &gt; 2) The P-CSCF correctly sends an ACK to Kate (Packet 1879)
 &gt; 3) The P-CSCF correctly sends an 486 to the S-CSCF (packet 1880)
 &gt; 4) The S-CSCF sends an ACK to P-CSCF (packet 1881  - via and branch
 &gt; look correct)
 &gt; 5) The S-CSCF correctly sends an 486 to the AS (Packet 1882)
 &gt; 6) The AS (seems) to correctly send an ACK to S-CSCF (packet 1883 -
 &gt; via and branch look correct)
 &gt; 7) The S-CSCF sends a spurious ACK to the P-CSCF (Packet 1884 See
 &gt; branch values...)
 &gt;
 &gt; At from this point onwards the P-CSCF keeps sending duplicates of 3)
 &gt; which triggers repeats of 4) to 7)
 &gt;
 &gt; So either the P-CSCF is not recognizing 4) or 7) is messing it's state up
 &gt;
 &gt; The other issue is that the when the INVITE is forwarded  to John and
 &gt; when John answers, his 200 OK finally reaches Alice and she sends an
 &gt; ACK (packet 1965). This ACK gets stuck at S-CSCF (Packet 1969)
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Any Thoughts?
 &gt;
 &gt; Regards
 &gt;
 &gt; Mark
