<PRE>A Happy New Year to all of you!

As the subject points out, I'm interested in finding out if 
someone is operating OSIMS using TCP as transport (IMS core 
and access, not only in the access). In addition I'd like to 
start a technical discussion on what changes are required to 
let OSIMS support alternative transport protocols beside UDP. 
I'd like to avoid hard-coding the transport in either SER or 
OSIMS modules. I.e., it should be possible to choose the 
transport protocol within the core using x-CSCF config script 
lines.

Background: As Section 18.1.1 of 3261 points out, streaming
protocols (e.g., TCP/SCTP) are mandatory as SIP transport if 
messages grow beyond a specific size (and yes, our signaling 
messages exceed this size already and fragmentation led to 
strange failures that required some hours of debugging until 
the reason was found). Accordingly, my personal believe is 
that UDP is not suited as signaling transport. You can never 
exclude fragmentation and never guarantee that one of the
(maybe third-party) AS will generate signaling messages that
fit into the supported MTU. So there is no alternative to 
using TCP or SCTP for signalling in IMS, generally speaking
for commercial IMS deployments and specifically for OSIMS
when wie consider interoperability tests with commercial 
IMS systems and IMS components.

Our first tries with TCP were unsuccessuful - if the client
uses TCP, OSIMS changes to UDP on the first hop (P-CSCF) and
uses UDP in the core. This might be fixable using the Service-
Route, but the same problem will occur when the S-CSCF routes 
to another domain. Here's where NAPTR support could fix the 
transport selection problem but according to the mailing list 
archives the SER people do not show huge interest in 
implementing NAPTR (or back-porting the OpenSER code) 
- see e.g. the thread following
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.iptel.org/pipermail/serdev/2006-July/007771.html">http://lists.iptel.org/pipermail/serdev/2006-July/007771.html</A>&gt;

We had similar problems when implementing some IMS functionality
on top of OpenSER. These problems were eventually solved by 
the OpenSER developers replacing/enhancing the stateful relaying 
function of OpenSER (t_relay()) and enabling NAPTR. (see
&lt;<A HREF="http://openser.org/pipermail/users/2005-December/002370.html">http://openser.org/pipermail/users/2005-December/002370.html</A>&gt;
for some details on the discussion). I'm afraid that this is
also required for OSIMS. Or do I miss something?

So, did someone already start work on switching transport from
TCP to UDP? Any plans to do so?

Regards
--Joachim
