<PRE>Hi Nour-Eddine,
 
Here are some answers to your questions:

The website that exists is <A HREF="http://www.openimscore.org/">http://www.openimscore.org/</A> and is the main site.
Some documentation exists there but not that much. There you can find a
general installation guide. Then there is also this mailinglist. Sorry that
you have had bad experience with it so far. When you ask your questions it's
good if you provide some more information, eg. what Linux distribution you
are running.

The IMS clients that exist you can find links to under the FAQ section on
the site under FAQ-&gt;IMS User endpoints-&gt;Is there a free IMS Client?. There
you will find links to three clients.

Some other good guides can be found at <A HREF="http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/">http://uctimsclient.berlios.de/</A> which
is the home of one of  the clients. There you find a guide of how to install
the Open IMS Core on Ubuntu (a good and fairly easy to use Linux distro).

As to your other questions:
Your question:
&quot;when i launch the files scscf.sh, icscf.sh, pcscf.sh they dont stop
execution and repeat the same messages:&quot;

Answer:
Short answer: It should be like that. Open one terminal window for each of
the CSCFs and one for the HSS and start all of them. To stop the HSS type
exit in the window. To stop the others hit Ctrl+C in each window or open one
more window and execute the scripts included &quot;stopser&quot; or &quot;killser&quot; if stop
dosen't work.

Some more answer: In the the default configuration that comes with Open IMS
Core the CSCFs print the log of what they are doing to the standard output
(stdout, which by default is the screen) and they print a detailed log. This
can be good as a start, since you can see what is going on. 

Your question:
About libmysql development.

Answer: The package can be called different things on different Linux
distributions. You indicate that you use &quot;yum&quot; a packge installer that takes
care of dependencies. I assume you are using some RedHat distro like Fedora
or CentOS. Then the package you have downloaded is not meant for your
distro. Try installing &quot;mysql-devel&quot; with &quot;yum install mysql-devel&quot;. This
should work if you have a RedHat distro, a Internet connection and yum
properly configured (should be done during installation of the distro).


SIPp is a good test tool that you can use to test the Open IMS Core
<A HREF="http://sipp.sourceforge.net/">http://sipp.sourceforge.net/</A>

You can also find some IMS scenarios for SIPp at
<A HREF="http://sipp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Scenarios">http://sipp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Scenarios</A>

The IMS Lantern is a good blog about IMS. Start reading it from the begining
or check the last post whith the index of the topics you need.
<A HREF="http://theimslantern.blogspot.com/">http://theimslantern.blogspot.com/</A>


Some books on the IMS topic (I have read the two first ones, and they are
fairly good and general. I think the first is easier to read)
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/3G-IP-Multimedia-Subsystem-IMS/dp/0470018186/ref=pd_bb">http://www.amazon.com/3G-IP-Multimedia-Subsystem-IMS/dp/0470018186/ref=pd_bb</A>

Good luck!
