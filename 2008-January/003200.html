<PRE>Hello Sabyasachi;
 
&gt;<i> In this e mail i have attached fresh trace as an attachment. When no
</I>&gt;<i> reliability is required or supported, both Open IMS and clients are
</I>&gt;<i> running fine. But when reliability option is enabled, PRACK message is
</I>&gt;<i> forwarded by the Open IMS to the terminating side (check frame 2413 to
</I>&gt;<i> 2617). As soon as the terminating side receives the PRACK it responds
</I>&gt;<i> with 200 OK response (check frames 2618 to 2629). But after that the
</I>&gt;<i> PRACK message is retransmitted in the Open IMS Entities and also to
</I>&gt;<i> the terminating side (check frames 2646). As the terminating side
</I>&gt;<i> sends the 200 OK response against PRACK , it send the 180 Ringing
</I>&gt;<i> message . This message is received in the originating side via Open
</I>&gt;<i> IMS. But when the originating side sends PRACK (For 180 Ringing having
</I>&gt;<i> Cseq= 4 Prack) , it is not received by the terminating side . Because
</I>&gt;<i> the terminating side receives the retransmitted PRACK (Cseq= 3 PRACK)
</I>&gt;<i> again and sends response against that.
</I>
It is an interesting issue, and it took me some time to find a possible
cause of this behaviour. The retransmissions of the PRACK request are in
fact done by the P-CSCF.

The problem I suppose has its root in a faulty sec-agree mechanism used by
your client. During registration your client only includes protected server
port parameters in the Security-Client header field. This faulty
Security-Client header field is ignored by the P-CSCF in the response (no
SAs are installed). But the next fault is that your client adds a
Security-Verify header field in INVITE and PRACK despite it had not received
a Security-Server header field in the REGISTER response.

Therefore I suggest to solve the sec-agree mechanism problems of your client
first. Maybe the strange behaviour of the P-CSCF is a result of this faults
in your client.

Regards
Franz
