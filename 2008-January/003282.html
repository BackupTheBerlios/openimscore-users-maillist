<PRE>Hello Kiran,

Please do not spam everybody with the same request, repeatedly. We have
received the first e-mail and we will answer as soon as possible. We do
not delete request, just defer them. If you don't receive any feedback
in a reasonable amount of time, please ask again, maybe we have made a
mistake... but not 3x/day...

For OpenIC_lite issues the right email address is the openic at
open-ims.org one. We are sorry, but it could take a few days until you
will receive your answer. Please understand that we are providing you
with best-effort support. You have so far not been charged, I believe,
for any of the Open-IMS components that you are using. If you would like
to be prioritized we could set-up a commercial collaboration that could
include the full OpenIC version and will suit your consulting as well as
technical support needs.

In the meantime, I would like to bring to you attention that just a few
days ago a very similar issue has been answered here:
<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openimscore-users/2008-January/004752.html">https://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/openimscore-users/2008-January/004752.html</A>
. There is a high probability that this also answers your questions. It
would help both of us if you could take a look at it.

Best Regards,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today we downloaded the OpenIC_lite for windows mobile and tried to
</I>&gt;<i> install and use the same. We were able to successfully install the
</I>&gt;<i> application on the mobile, but when we started the application, it
</I>&gt;<i> gives an error saying &#8220;Could not find J9 Path&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have tried on Motorola Q9, Toshiba G900, HTC and all have the same
</I>&gt;<i> problem. So it looks like a problem on the OpenIC_lite package, can we
</I>&gt;<i> get some support from you to resolve the same.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
