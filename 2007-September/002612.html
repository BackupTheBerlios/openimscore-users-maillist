<PRE>Guys, I think that a little bit of clarification is needed here.

So, you could do IPSec in many ways (I am not an IPSec specialist, but
I'll try and explain it in my understanding).

First option would be to use it in tunnel mode - then you have a virtual
interface that you use as a normal one, yet all traffic would be
encrypted when sent over the real network interface. This method has the
advantage that it is completely transparent.

The second option is to use it in transport mode. Then you can indicate
on the originator that all packet that follow a rule (source ip/port,
destination ip/port, protocol, etc) must be encrypted with a key. On the
terminating side, you indicate that everything that matches a rule must
be successfully decrypted with a key and all other traffic is to be
discarded.

On the Gm interface we use the 2nd option, transport mode. For securing
the other interfaces you can use very well the first option.

Then about key sharing. ISAKMP is good, but it is not the standard IMS
method. As 3GPP recommends, the keys are practically shared through AKA
in the first REGISTER message, which is unencrypted. In practice, the
HSS computes a couple of CK, IK keys based on a random, the network
secret and a user secret. The random is in the challenge nonce and the
CK and IK are sent until the P-CSCF, which removes and uses them for the
IPSec SAs. The client would use the AKA in a ISIM card (or a simulation
of a card, like SIPp does) to compute the CK and IK based on the random
and secrets that it knows. The CK and IK and not sent over the Gm
interface for obvious security issues.

After the first REGISTER message, if both the UE and the network have
the right credentials, the SA can be set and the new SA can be
successfully used.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Divya,
</I>&gt;<i> Looking at your pcap traces, it does not seem possible that the tunnel
</I>&gt;<i> was created by SIP; the setup on the PCSCF side appears to have the
</I>&gt;<i> correct SA/SP values - so somehow the IPSEC scripts got run there. Did
</I>&gt;<i> you do that manually?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;From the UE side, it seems the tunnel was created by hand first then a
</I>&gt;<i> session was run across? The SIP messages are visible in clear text and
</I>&gt;<i> neither does any side advertise their ipsec properties via sip
</I>&gt;<i> security-* headers.
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly: I dont think that the UE client you used is capable of IPSEC;
</I>&gt;<i> you said it can take ipsec parameters - it just doesnt seem to use them
</I>&gt;<i> on SIP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cheers,
