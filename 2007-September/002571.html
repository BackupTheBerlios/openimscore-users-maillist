<PRE>I am using automatic keying for ipsec and did not add any SA's manually. I 
defined only the security policies.
I observed that the windows and linux m/c exchange ISAKMP packets on the 
defaulted port (500).
This establishes SA between the 2 m/cs. Thus Register msg is not the first 
msg exchanged between them
and thus is sent as an ESP packet. Once the security handshake is done 
over SIP using the 1st register and the 401
new SAs are created.
Unfortunately the call logs I last shared do not have it captured. I am 
sending the registration logs again. 
This should make things more clear.

Jamal, 
 if you look at the logs that i sent to the group when ipsec was not 
working and all msgs were exchanged in 
plain text... u will observe that the 
UE does send the 1st Register msg with a security-client header
P-CSCF inserting a security-server header in 401
the 2nd Register msg with security-verify header ( constructed from the 
security-server header of 401).

(24.229)The P-CSCF shall remove and store the Security-Client header 
before forwarding the request to the S-CSCF; 
Due to which the security headers cannot be seen in the logs.

</I>Hi Divya,
Looking at your pcap traces, it does not seem possible that the tunnel
was created by SIP; the setup on the PCSCF side appears to have the
correct SA/SP values - so somehow the IPSEC scripts got run there. Did
you do that manually?
&gt;<i>From the UE side, it seems the tunnel was created by hand first then a
</I>session was run across? The SIP messages are visible in clear text and
neither does any side advertise their ipsec properties via sip
security-* headers.
Lastly: I dont think that the UE client you used is capable of IPSEC;
you said it can take ipsec parameters - it just doesnt seem to use them
on SIP.

cheers,
jamal
