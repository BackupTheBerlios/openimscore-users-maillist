<PRE>I used code revision 419. 
I did see Sanjeev's mail and the logs he sent. Theres a difference in what 
I observed though.
In my case the security tunnel was used right from the first register msg.
I used ESP with pre-shared-key.
How did you establish the ipsec connection ?

Regards,
Divya

Re: [OpenIMSCore-Users] Registeration over IPSec fails







What is revision number of the code that you are using?? Asking this 
because with my UE, I was successfully able to REGISTER over IPSEC with 
revision number 312 ( a month ago). With the later versions (I tried with 
397), I was not able to register over ipsec. Currently Im not looking into 
the problem but would get onto that in near future. So if you can let me 
know the revision number, I think I would straight away try with that. ( 
You might have seen Sanjeev's mail on the ipsec issue. We both are working 
on the same stuff). 

Thanks and regards,
Purna Chandar M

[OpenIMSCore-Users] Registeration over IPSec fails






Hi Klemens, 
The UE in my case is not not using ipsec to send the 2nd Register. The 
ipsec connection is not properly setup since the tcpdump and ping results 
are not in ah/esp! 
I am not able to figure out whats going wrong in the configuration. 
I have tried various thing I found googling around. Can you pls. suggest 
any pointers on how to setup an ipsec connection between fedora 6 and 
windows 2000. 
Thanks &amp; regards, 
Divya
