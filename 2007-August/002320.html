Hi Babu,
 
Thanks for the response !!!
 
I am not sure how to check if the N95 is doing the pcscf discovery, what is happening, is that the mobile is initiating the PDP Context activation procedure and then shows registering for service, but nothing seems to be happening for that.
 
Right now we are configuring the GGSN with a new APN, and the APN address to be that of the IMS core. Can you throw some light on the GGSN configuration for this.
 
Do we need the GGSN to have a Go/Gm interface for this to work ??
 
Thanks,
Kiran.

Kiran, 

  Is the handset discovering the PCSCF(through PDP/ DHCP)? Also handset should make the DNS query to resolve the IP Address. 

Regards 

Babu

Subject: [OpenIMSCore-Users] IMS Registration through GGSN 

Hi, 

I am trying to do a IMS registration over a UMTS network in our lab. The GGSN is release-5 compliant. I am not able to see the register message reach the pcscf. We have configured the ggsn to do a DNS resolution for the domain name(proxy) configured in the mobile. We are using a Nokia N95 for this purpose. 

Can someone please tell me if this is going to work this way with openIMS and also what I need to check/configure. 

Thanks in advance, 

Regards, 

Kiran.
