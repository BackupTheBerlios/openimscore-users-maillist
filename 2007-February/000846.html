<PRE>Dear all,

Thank you for your comments! Today's Sun, so noone's at work, however,
on Mon or Tue my teammates and I will have a meeting and I'll
definitely get back to you on the same thread for more questions :-)

  Andrey.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * A great thing as well as a challenge with SER is indeed it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flexibility. You can indeed implement B2BUAish functionality in SER.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The basic stance is that if you can do it in a module, you are welcome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to that. However, SER's core value proposition is based on its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performance and flexibility, not its abilities as a B2BUA. Thus, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; core of SER is &quot;defended&quot; against any  movement towards B2BUA, AS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; functionality. The belief is that this will endanger SER's core value
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposition without necessary making a good B2BUA or AS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * SER does have its cousin SEMS, which is by now a full B2BUA. I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; difficulty seeing why it shouldn't be called an AS (it also uses SER's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SIP stack as a front-end). SEMS can either stay in the SIP dialog path
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or both in SIP and media.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * A rule of thumb (as of today) is that anything that requires full
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dialog state should not be done in SER. SER's configuration logic does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not lend itself easily to handle dialogs and it is easier to do using SEMS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * There are grey areas, presence is one.  There will always be grey
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; areas and my guess is that we will see SER covering more of them as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time goes.  Maybe even a new ser-dialog.cfg that can handle dialogs on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a dialog, not transaction level (this is not an authoritative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statement, just my personal feeling)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * I also hope that we can see SER as a front-end (just like SEMS is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using SER) for more AS-type solutions. I know that a company has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; created a (commercial) JSLEEish SER module. Personally, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extending SER application interface is important. The upcoming SER
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; user group meeting in Prague will probably see a presentation of work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in progress on this

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi Andrey,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; First, let me make some things clear. The best way to integrate an AS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; into Open IMS Core (or any other IMS network) is to make use of the ISC
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; interface and not by changing the scscf.cfg. You can define in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; user's service profile on the HSS different filters and on match, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; initial request will be forwarded to the indicated application servers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The scscf.cfg should not be changed except for operator specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; settings (some things are optional, customizable, etc). We did modify it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; slightly for example to route to PSTN as this something usually common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for all users, but Shared IFC is on the roadmap and will be there to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; just that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am saying the things above, just to rule out misunderstandings. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; guess that you did not mean that, but I just want to be sure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Then, regarding the use of SER as an application server (or SER+cdp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; module, if you'd like to call it OpenIMS). Recently I have questioned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the targeted usage of SER on the development list there. One relevant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; conclusion stands out: SER is a SIP proxy and should no be abused as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; AS. Now I know that this is contradictory with what happens actually in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; SER, as there are application server modules in the main tree  (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; presence application server), but this is the position of the core
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; developers there. So considered yourself warned ;-) and prepare yourself
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to be disappointed if you want to do barring with a B2BUA by using SER.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you have lots of programming resources, you can do it, no pb.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; However, SER does have great performance and flexibility, so a simple AS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would be very easy to hack in. The CDP module offers you support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Diameter but you still need a module/functionality for the Sh interface
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with the HSS if you want that. I was thinking about it, but so far
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; nobody was interested. If we get some more interest here, we could put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; it on the road-map.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am not sure that I was clear enough, but I am very interested in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; continuing this thread.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Has anyone tried to implement or implemented AS's of any kind on OpenIMS?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; For instance, Call Barring AS. As I understand (and, please, correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; me if im wrong), many other AS's are already available on OpenIMS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; like presence or IM. These servers can be implemented by playing with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; ser.cfg. However, some cannot be. Therefore, I am interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; most *efficient* (quick) way to implement AS's on OpenIMS. Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; trying accomplish this with my ser.cfg or would it be adding an extra
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; module to SER or both?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; If im not clear (i am actually confused myself), please, let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I would be happy to clarify my problem.
