<PRE>Hi,

We decided to do two db modes, one like you suggested, all dumped at a time in one row of the table, and an other separating per element, using entry_id. Separating per element can be good in situations where you have a lot of info already in memory and you don't want to exhaust it when dumping because of serializing everything into x buffer before persisting.

This entry id could be a serial, if we don't do searches and load all. But, in the future, maybe we can consider implementing a cache mechanism (e.g. after dumping snapshots remove from memory expired info), and in this case it's necessary to be able to identify an element to retrieve. This way we use, for example, for the auth information, private and public identities as id.

These two modules will allow to test and choose between larger memory consumption or many db accesses. The second db mode also makes it less difficult to implement new persistency approaches (like the cache).

Regarding the large number of sequential INSERTs when dumping, we can look into using PostgreSQL's prepared statements in order to improve dumping times.

The next mails can take place in the list. My mail is <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/openimscore-users">mariojvp at gmail.com.</A>

Assunto: [01_persistency] New branch created

Hi all,

As you have probably noticed, in the last days I have branched the
ser_ims project and did some commits there. In case that you are curios
and/or want to help, we are working on putting some persistency support
into the CSCFs (especially P&amp;S). One of the differences between the
registrar storage that we have and the usrloc module is that we do not
yet have any support for saving that data anywhere, so on any restart of
the CSCFs, those are empty. Normally, for simple test purposes, you
would not need to restart them and the stability seems pretty good
relative to our non-carrier-grade purposes (there are no outstanding
CSCF crashing bugs now).

However, these things happen and the the project's purposes is no excuse
for having a better reliability. Plus that when you use it in a real
trial with several hundreds of real users, like we do, it becomes pretty
annoying when one CSCF crashes and you have all those angry users who
did not do anything at all and now they need to re-register.

Before I would start detailing it a little, I would just want to say
that even if we will have this thing in, that allows you to just restart
the CSCF on a crash, that would be a bad idea as you will probably not
report a bug back to us - it fixes the effect, not the cause. Rather our
main purpose here would be to allow you to do configuration changes and
restart the CSCFs without loosing the state.

The approach that we would like to take is that of making periodic full
snapshots. The interval should be configurable. If you are more
aggressive about the stability and you also have more users, making full
snapshots can be quite expensive and many might use quite high intervals
if they do not have too much traffic. In this situations, incremental
changes could be dumped at lower intervals or, in the most aggressive
case, immediately after a change. Then retrieving the state would be
done by loading the last snapshot + following changes.

The first step was to write the codec for storing/retrieving the data
into/from data blocks. This is nearly completed in bin.c/h for basic
data types and bin_scscf.c/h for the S-CSCF data structures. We have
chosen a binary format over xml or something else due to space
considerations. Assuming a 2-3Kbytes/subscriber, then we quickly get to
hundreds of Megabytes to store. The XML service profile for one is about
70% smaller in a binary format than in XML.

Then the s_persistency.c/h is supposed to implement the dumping/loading
functions for snapshots. Now we have this working for the authorization
vectors and dialogs hash tables. The snapshots are done on timers at
configurable intervals and also when you break the execution, on the
shutdown procedures. The last snapshot is loaded on start-up.

For now the data is dumped into files and we are also working on
database support.

We would be very interested in your opinions, contributions, impressions
and anything else that you might think about this. If you decide to give
it a try, you can get it from the SVN under
ser_ims/branches/01.persistency. Remember though that this is highly
experimental and as there are different people working on it, commits
happen often for visibility reasons and many things might be broken. So
speak now, before most of the work would be done.
