<PRE>I just want to chip in some comments here:
 * A great thing as well as a challenge with SER is indeed it's 
flexibility. You can indeed implement B2BUAish functionality in SER. The 
basic stance is that if you can do it in a module, you are welcome to 
that. However, SER's core value proposition is based on its performance 
and flexibility, not its abilities as a B2BUA. Thus, the core of SER is 
&quot;defended&quot; against any  movement towards B2BUA, AS functionality. The 
belief is that this will endanger SER's core value proposition without 
necessary making a good B2BUA or AS
 * SER does have its cousin SEMS, which is by now a full B2BUA. I have 
difficulty seeing why it shouldn't be called an AS (it also uses SER's 
SIP stack as a front-end). SEMS can either stay in the SIP dialog path 
or both in SIP and media.
 * A rule of thumb (as of today) is that anything that requires full 
dialog state should not be done in SER. SER's configuration logic does 
not lend itself easily to handle dialogs and it is easier to do using SEMS
 * There are grey areas, presence is one.  There will always be grey 
areas and my guess is that we will see SER covering more of them as time 
goes.  Maybe even a new ser-dialog.cfg that can handle dialogs on a 
dialog, not transaction level (this is not an authoritative statement, 
just my personal feeling)
 * I also hope that we can see SER as a front-end (just like SEMS is 
using SER) for more AS-type solutions. I know that a company has created 
a (commercial) JSLEEish SER module. Personally, I believe extending SER 
application interface is important. The upcoming SER user group meeting 
in Prague will probably see a presentation of work in progress on this

</I>&gt;<i> First, let me make some things clear. The best way to integrate an AS
</I>&gt;<i> into Open IMS Core (or any other IMS network) is to make use of the ISC
</I>&gt;<i> interface and not by changing the scscf.cfg. You can define in the
</I>&gt;<i> user's service profile on the HSS different filters and on match, the
</I>&gt;<i> initial request will be forwarded to the indicated application servers.
</I>&gt;<i> The scscf.cfg should not be changed except for operator specific
</I>&gt;<i> settings (some things are optional, customizable, etc). We did modify it
</I>&gt;<i> slightly for example to route to PSTN as this something usually common
</I>&gt;<i> for all users, but Shared IFC is on the roadmap and will be there to do
</I>&gt;<i> just that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am saying the things above, just to rule out misunderstandings. I
</I>&gt;<i> guess that you did not mean that, but I just want to be sure
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, regarding the use of SER as an application server (or SER+cdp
</I>&gt;<i> module, if you'd like to call it OpenIMS). Recently I have questioned
</I>&gt;<i> the targeted usage of SER on the development list there. One relevant
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion stands out: SER is a SIP proxy and should no be abused as an
</I>&gt;<i> AS. Now I know that this is contradictory with what happens actually in
</I>&gt;<i> SER, as there are application server modules in the main tree  (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> presence application server), but this is the position of the core
</I>&gt;<i> developers there. So considered yourself warned ;-) and prepare yourself
</I>&gt;<i> to be disappointed if you want to do barring with a B2BUA by using SER.
</I>&gt;<i> If you have lots of programming resources, you can do it, no pb.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, SER does have great performance and flexibility, so a simple AS
</I>&gt;<i> would be very easy to hack in. The CDP module offers you support for
</I>&gt;<i> Diameter but you still need a module/functionality for the Sh interface
</I>&gt;<i> with the HSS if you want that. I was thinking about it, but so far
</I>&gt;<i> nobody was interested. If we get some more interest here, we could put
</I>&gt;<i> it on the road-map.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure that I was clear enough, but I am very interested in
</I>&gt;<i> continuing this thread.
