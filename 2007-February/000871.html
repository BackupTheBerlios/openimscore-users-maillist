Oh no.. I was just under impression that you can use SER releases to
upgrade OpenIMS. Guess, I was wrong. However, you've said &quot;Also, we
are trying to push
back to SER all our modifications so that you could just take any SER
core and add the modules...&quot;. Does that mean you want to make OpenIMS
and SER kind of compatible or smth?

&gt;<i> 2. If you refer to the HSS side of Sh, that should already be there, in
</I>&gt;<i> FHoSS. For the AS side, we do not have any AS in the plan. The focus is
</I>&gt;<i> on the core network and that does not include clients or AS. As such,
</I>&gt;<i> the Sh interface module for SER is not there because nobody would
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it at the moment. I do have a stub - that means just some code
</I>&gt;<i> gathered in a module named Sh that does not do anything useful at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment. If someone would like to contribute, I would certainly give that
</I>&gt;<i> out and open a branch for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you (or anybody else) are interested and could contribute, just
</I>&gt;<i> let me know. But at the moment I am swamped with other things and can

</I>&gt;<i> things in the SVN (like the SIP2IMS Gateway now, unfortunately).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If we implement any AS's during the process (and most certainly we'd
have to), I'd love to contribute those to OpenIMS. As for Sh
interface, this was not in our plans really. :(  However, one wouldnt
work without the other...  I really dont know what to make out of it,
but let me talk with my teammates about that. So, im leaving this
issue open for further discussions ;-)

&gt;<i> Our source code policy is that the trunks of each project have 1 person
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for any changes. This is because we want to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> conflicting changes in the &quot;stable&quot; tree. Of course, we accept patches
</I>&gt;<i> here, but they have to be piped through the respective maintainer. And
</I>&gt;<i> if certain projects would grow too much, then this responsibility would
</I>&gt;<i> be split between several maintainers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, for branches, we are accepting any contributions and there is
</I>&gt;<i> no reason to think that unresolvable conflicts would happen there if we
</I>&gt;<i> allow a wiki style access.
</I>&gt;<i>

Ok.

 Thanks,

   Andrey.
