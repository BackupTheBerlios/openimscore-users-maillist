<PRE>Hi Ben,

First, as an advice, if I many, I guess that in the spirit of open
source you will find out that it will be better for people integrating
the code in their project to offer the code as CVS/SVN download-able.
Having every-time to get an archive by filling in my e-mail address is
not getting you downloads from developers ;-). Why the nice sourceforge
addresses and stuff then? Is you boss really not getting into the spirit
and really wants to count downloads? ;-)

- about the rest of the 3GPP/3GPP2 interfaces, you are right, we mostly
care about 2: Cx and Sh. This is just because in our scope we do not
need more. We would welcome more, if anyone would use them, but there is
no real interest so far and I for one don't like things that are there
just for numbers and are never used.

- the interfaces are mostly Rel.6 with almost all Rel.7 updates. But as
I said before, if we don't use something there is no point in having it.
Soon a full Rel.7 functionality will be rolled-out (e.g. see the HSS
branch) and then also this interfaces will have all the whistles.
However... as far as I see it, we are just talking about some constants,
right? There is no difference in the diameter stacks for Rel5-&gt;7, right?

- standards are great sometimes. However, we deal with the core network
and we favor greater performance against plug-ability. I mean, in the
end, how many times do you change your diameter stack? Of course, we
have considered implementing the API, but it was simply more easy,
efficient and fast to just use the API that the light-weight stack now
implements. Some people here felt very strongly, but in the end it was
just inefficient to spend time on it. This might also be because I hate
for example writing a class AVPUserName, which extends AVP and actually
is there just because some users are too lazy to remember or define a
constant for the AVP Code.

- as I just said in the previous point, I don't see the point of
defining new things just because some users are lazy and don't want to
read a documentation. In C/JavaDiameterPeer you can at any time write
use any possible AVP, vendor specific or not. Yes, we do have to work a
little on encoding, but so far no complaints. I think that in any
implementation, including ours, you will probably want to write your
wrappers for messages, avps, etc. So why write one more in the stack, or
do you think that writing a generic one in the stack is going to be more
efficient? Advertising all those interface names is just something that
we, with a non-commercial target, don't care too much.

... well, tastes ;-)

- no, OpenIMS Core IS GPL LICENSED. The old license from SIP Express
Router (which is used as a base for the project) is GPLv2 and you can
not change such a license. You are talking about a disclaimer, a warning
that we have put upfront and in any source file that we have.

The disclaimer there only warns you that in case you use it in a
commercial product you should be aware of the pending patents and also
disclaims us from being sued by implementing a patented technology, like
IMS is. As such, feel free to remove that part and use it commercially
for all we care, but you have been warned. This is something that I am
sure that no Diameter stack, including OpenBloX can avoid. So small
letters or not, we wanted to warn the user, at least.

I know that this is nasty territory, but the truth is that we do not
live in an ideal world and patents can touch you even if you use open
source. IMHO this is the reality when you can put patents on ideas.

I will end this by saying that we will certainly take a peek at how you
approached realm-routing ;-) as this is on our roadmap for the Diameter
stack.

Cheers,
-Dragos

</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you are well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess by now you found out you can download the code from
</I>&gt;<i> www.traffixsystems.com &lt;<A HREF="http://www.traffixsystems.com/">http://www.traffixsystems.com/</A>&gt; (Traffix is
</I>&gt;<i> proudly supporting the OpenBloX GPL project)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked at the stacks you mentioned, some important differences to
</I>&gt;<i> take into account before implantation are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#167;   OpenBloX Diameter encapsulates _all the 3GPP and 3GPP2 interfaces_
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211; more than 30 currently!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#167;   I noticed your implantation supports mostly Rel.5(&quot;for Cx we are
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat at Rel.5...&quot; - OpenBloX Diameter supports the _latest Rel.7_
</I>&gt;<i> (Q4/06 versions)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#167;   OpenBloX is using the JDiameter API, an Open Source industry
</I>&gt;<i> initiative led by contributors like Ericsson, Jntex and Mobicents to
</I>&gt;<i> create &quot;de facto&quot; JSLEE standart Diameter API - I'm sure you can see
</I>&gt;<i> the benefit and advantage of using this API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#167;   OpenBloX is customized with vendor specific AVP's used by
</I>&gt;<i> different Operators &#8211; again you can see the integration benefit here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#167;   Most important for users is that OpenIMS is (and excuse me if I'm
</I>&gt;<i> wrong but this is written in your site)not GPL licensed and can not be
</I>&gt;<i> used in any commercial context _(&quot;Open Source IMS Core System is not
</I>&gt;<i> intended to become or act as a product in a commercial context!&quot;_) &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> OpenBloX is pure GPL with no small letters attached.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe you understand better now why OpenBloX Diameter is so much
</I>&gt;<i> needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will be happy if you'll test OpenBloX yourself and see closely the
</I>&gt;<i> code quality &amp; robustness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope we could collaborate, now that you see clearly the OpenBloX
</I>&gt;<i> Diameter advantage.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Colleague Ben :),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your announcement. But I am a little confused. Although
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you have many release announcements, I couldn't download anything. Your
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CVS is empty <A HREF="http://openblox.cvs.sourceforge.net/openblox/">http://openblox.cvs.sourceforge.net/openblox/</A> and also the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Download section is empty too

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=184116">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=184116</A> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, in case you missed it, I would like to inform you that we already
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> have not one, but 2 Diameter stacks, the JavaDiameterPeer and the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CDiameterPeer. You can access them through SVN
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/openimscore/JavaDiameterPeer/?rev=0&amp;sc=0">http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/openimscore/JavaDiameterPeer/?rev=0&amp;sc=0</A>  or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you could get daily snapshots from here
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/openimscore/snapshots/">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/openimscore/snapshots/</A> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that we would be very interested in reading what would the
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> technical advantages of OpenBloX over JavaDiameterPeer in the IMS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> context. It's a pity that we hear so late about your product, but we
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> have started developing our Diameter stacks more than a year ago and now
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> they are tightly integrated into our components.  Besides the CSCFs and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HSS, also, they have been successfully used in various Application
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Servers. However, we still have things that are missing and we would be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> interested for sure in your solutions. Do you support SCTP for example?
</I>&gt;<i>
