</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Let's not forget that most applications are not like OpenIMS, where you 
implement new standards, not applications... As long as you try to 
develop a standard SIP application you should not have to &quot;dig into 
[ser's/sems] core&quot;. Both ser and sems have nice plugin interfaces that 
will enable you to quickly develop pretty much any standard SIP 
application.
&gt;<i> Also, this project might be interesting for you: <A HREF="http://www.wesip.com/">http://www.wesip.com/</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> But I have to say that the architecture is kind of awkward - let's not
</I>&gt;<i> forget that SIP servlets are defined already and why not build the SIP
</I>&gt;<i> stack in the App Server? (personally I hate complex solutions).
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Wesip is commercial, why not use Mobicents?
Also, a think a blogpost I wrote yesterday may be of interest in this 
context:

&gt;<i> And in the most cases, taking a SIP stack and building a little around
</I>&gt;<i> it will get you there quite fast. You only have to choose one that has
</I>&gt;<i> as many bells and whistles as you require, while still making sense out
</I>&gt;<i> of them - have you considered <A HREF="http://www.pjsip.org/">http://www.pjsip.org/</A> ?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * A great thing as well as a challenge with SER is indeed it's

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The basic stance is that if you can do it in a module, you are welcome
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to that. However, SER's core value proposition is based on its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performance and flexibility, not its abilities as a B2BUA. Thus, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> core of SER is &quot;defended&quot; against any  movement towards B2BUA, AS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functionality. The belief is that this will endanger SER's core value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposition without necessary making a good B2BUA or AS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * SER does have its cousin SEMS, which is by now a full B2BUA. I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difficulty seeing why it shouldn't be called an AS (it also uses SER's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SIP stack as a front-end). SEMS can either stay in the SIP dialog path
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or both in SIP and media.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * A rule of thumb (as of today) is that anything that requires full
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dialog state should not be done in SER. SER's configuration logic does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not lend itself easily to handle dialogs and it is easier to do using SEMS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * There are grey areas, presence is one.  There will always be grey
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> areas and my guess is that we will see SER covering more of them as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time goes.  Maybe even a new ser-dialog.cfg that can handle dialogs on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a dialog, not transaction level (this is not an authoritative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statement, just my personal feeling)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  * I also hope that we can see SER as a front-end (just like SEMS is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using SER) for more AS-type solutions. I know that a company has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> created a (commercial) JSLEEish SER module. Personally, I believe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extending SER application interface is important. The upcoming SER

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in progress on this

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Andrey,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First, let me make some things clear. The best way to integrate an AS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> into Open IMS Core (or any other IMS network) is to make use of the ISC
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> interface and not by changing the scscf.cfg. You can define in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> user's service profile on the HSS different filters and on match, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> initial request will be forwarded to the indicated application servers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The scscf.cfg should not be changed except for operator specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> settings (some things are optional, customizable, etc). We did modify it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> slightly for example to route to PSTN as this something usually common
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for all users, but Shared IFC is on the roadmap and will be there to do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am saying the things above, just to rule out misunderstandings. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> guess that you did not mean that, but I just want to be sure
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Then, regarding the use of SER as an application server (or SER+cdp
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> module, if you'd like to call it OpenIMS). Recently I have questioned
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the targeted usage of SER on the development list there. One relevant
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> conclusion stands out: SER is a SIP proxy and should no be abused as an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> AS. Now I know that this is contradictory with what happens actually in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> SER, as there are application server modules in the main tree  (e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> presence application server), but this is the position of the core
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> developers there. So considered yourself warned ;-) and prepare yourself
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to be disappointed if you want to do barring with a B2BUA by using SER.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you have lots of programming resources, you can do it, no pb.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, SER does have great performance and flexibility, so a simple AS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be very easy to hack in. The CDP module offers you support for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Diameter but you still need a module/functionality for the Sh interface
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with the HSS if you want that. I was thinking about it, but so far
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> nobody was interested. If we get some more interest here, we could put
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it on the road-map.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure that I was clear enough, but I am very interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> continuing this thread.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone tried to implement or implemented AS's of any kind on OpenIMS?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For instance, Call Barring AS. As I understand (and, please, correct
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> me if im wrong), many other AS's are already available on OpenIMS:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like presence or IM. These servers can be implemented by playing with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ser.cfg. However, some cannot be. Therefore, I am interested in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most *efficient* (quick) way to implement AS's on OpenIMS. Would it be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trying accomplish this with my ser.cfg or would it be adding an extra
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> module to SER or both?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If im not clear (i am actually confused myself), please, let me know.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would be happy to clarify my problem.
