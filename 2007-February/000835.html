<PRE>Hi Dragos,

I think I am quite clear. Anyway, i've got some questions, but let me
explain our ultimate goal first :).

We (my teammates and I) have taken on a project, in which we will
implement a module that will be used to resolve unwanted interactions
between different AS's, such as forwarding a call from party B to
party C, where originator of this call is party A and A doesnt want to
talk to C :)). So, technically, at first we need a couple or more AS's
to get ourselves started. Trivial AS's like call barring, call
forwarding on busy or unconditionally, caller ID hiding, 3pcc, black
list, presence, instant messaging, conferencing and voicemail, etc
would be most desirable at the moment (I guess that's quite the list,
but we really need them!)

So, there come the questions:

1. Any of these AS's exist at the moment (open-source) ?
2. Weird question, but here it goes: what would be the most efficient
way to create these AS's? This question is a bit too vague. Maybe, we
should leave it for further discussions in a separate thread?
3. Are there any good documents on OpenIMS website regarding ISC
interface you've discussed (plz, dont answer, if yes; i'll just go get
them)
4. Can you expand more on Sh interface? How long will it take to
implement? Can we just query HSS db directly (as far as i know, it's
still MySQL tables :))

I'll be back with more questions and I also do hope to continue this
thread discussion. :)

  King regards,

     Andrey.

&gt;<i> Hi Andrey,

</I>&gt;<i> First, let me make some things clear. The best way to integrate an AS
</I>&gt;<i> into Open IMS Core (or any other IMS network) is to make use of the ISC
</I>&gt;<i> interface and not by changing the scscf.cfg. You can define in the
</I>&gt;<i> user's service profile on the HSS different filters and on match, the
</I>&gt;<i> initial request will be forwarded to the indicated application servers.
</I>&gt;<i> The scscf.cfg should not be changed except for operator specific
</I>&gt;<i> settings (some things are optional, customizable, etc). We did modify it
</I>&gt;<i> slightly for example to route to PSTN as this something usually common
</I>&gt;<i> for all users, but Shared IFC is on the roadmap and will be there to do
</I>&gt;<i> just that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am saying the things above, just to rule out misunderstandings. I
</I>&gt;<i> guess that you did not mean that, but I just want to be sure
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, regarding the use of SER as an application server (or SER+cdp
</I>&gt;<i> module, if you'd like to call it OpenIMS). Recently I have questioned
</I>&gt;<i> the targeted usage of SER on the development list there. One relevant
</I>&gt;<i> conclusion stands out: SER is a SIP proxy and should no be abused as an
</I>&gt;<i> AS. Now I know that this is contradictory with what happens actually in
</I>&gt;<i> SER, as there are application server modules in the main tree  (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> presence application server), but this is the position of the core
</I>&gt;<i> developers there. So considered yourself warned ;-) and prepare yourself
</I>&gt;<i> to be disappointed if you want to do barring with a B2BUA by using SER.
</I>&gt;<i> If you have lots of programming resources, you can do it, no pb.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, SER does have great performance and flexibility, so a simple AS
</I>&gt;<i> would be very easy to hack in. The CDP module offers you support for
</I>&gt;<i> Diameter but you still need a module/functionality for the Sh interface
</I>&gt;<i> with the HSS if you want that. I was thinking about it, but so far
</I>&gt;<i> nobody was interested. If we get some more interest here, we could put
</I>&gt;<i> it on the road-map.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure that I was clear enough, but I am very interested in
</I>&gt;<i> continuing this thread.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Has anyone tried to implement or implemented AS's of any kind on OpenIMS?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For instance, Call Barring AS. As I understand (and, please, correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me if im wrong), many other AS's are already available on OpenIMS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like presence or IM. These servers can be implemented by playing with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ser.cfg. However, some cannot be. Therefore, I am interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most *efficient* (quick) way to implement AS's on OpenIMS. Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying accomplish this with my ser.cfg or would it be adding an extra
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; module to SER or both?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If im not clear (i am actually confused myself), please, let me know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would be happy to clarify my problem.
