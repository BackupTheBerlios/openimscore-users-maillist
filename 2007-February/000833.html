<PRE>Hi Andrey,

First, let me make some things clear. The best way to integrate an AS
into Open IMS Core (or any other IMS network) is to make use of the ISC
interface and not by changing the scscf.cfg. You can define in the
user's service profile on the HSS different filters and on match, the
initial request will be forwarded to the indicated application servers.
The scscf.cfg should not be changed except for operator specific
settings (some things are optional, customizable, etc). We did modify it
slightly for example to route to PSTN as this something usually common
for all users, but Shared IFC is on the roadmap and will be there to do
just that.

I am saying the things above, just to rule out misunderstandings. I
guess that you did not mean that, but I just want to be sure

Then, regarding the use of SER as an application server (or SER+cdp
module, if you'd like to call it OpenIMS). Recently I have questioned
the targeted usage of SER on the development list there. One relevant
conclusion stands out: SER is a SIP proxy and should no be abused as an
AS. Now I know that this is contradictory with what happens actually in
SER, as there are application server modules in the main tree  (e.g.
presence application server), but this is the position of the core
developers there. So considered yourself warned ;-) and prepare yourself
to be disappointed if you want to do barring with a B2BUA by using SER.
If you have lots of programming resources, you can do it, no pb.

However, SER does have great performance and flexibility, so a simple AS
would be very easy to hack in. The CDP module offers you support for
Diameter but you still need a module/functionality for the Sh interface
with the HSS if you want that. I was thinking about it, but so far
nobody was interested. If we get some more interest here, we could put
it on the road-map.

I am not sure that I was clear enough, but I am very interested in
continuing this thread.
