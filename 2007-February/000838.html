Thanx for the chip-in, especially as I failed to indicate SEMS, although
it's a better candidate than SER.

As Greger says, you can easily get an AS from SER and/or SEMS by just
playing with the config files. But once you need advanced state you will
need to consider writing your own modules. So the adaptation curve is
very nice at the beginning but then for complex application you will hit
a bump that will force you to dig into it's core. Anyway, this bump
continues to get smaller every day as new things get contributed.

Also, this project might be interesting for you: <A HREF="http://www.wesip.com/">http://www.wesip.com/</A> .
But I have to say that the architecture is kind of awkward - let's not
forget that SIP servlets are defined already and why not build the SIP
stack in the App Server? (personally I hate complex solutions).

And in the most cases, taking a SIP stack and building a little around
it will get you there quite fast. You only have to choose one that has
as many bells and whistles as you require, while still making sense out
of them - have you considered <A HREF="http://www.pjsip.org/">http://www.pjsip.org/</A> ?

</I>&gt;<i>  * SER does have its cousin SEMS, which is by now a full B2BUA. I have
</I>&gt;<i> difficulty seeing why it shouldn't be called an AS (it also uses SER's
</I>&gt;<i> SIP stack as a front-end). SEMS can either stay in the SIP dialog path
</I>&gt;<i> or both in SIP and media.
</I>&gt;<i>  * A rule of thumb (as of today) is that anything that requires full
</I>&gt;<i> dialog state should not be done in SER. SER's configuration logic does
</I>&gt;<i> not lend itself easily to handle dialogs and it is easier to do using SEMS
</I>&gt;<i>  * There are grey areas, presence is one.  There will always be grey
</I>&gt;<i> areas and my guess is that we will see SER covering more of them as
</I>&gt;<i> time goes.  Maybe even a new ser-dialog.cfg that can handle dialogs on
</I>&gt;<i> a dialog, not transaction level (this is not an authoritative
</I>&gt;<i> statement, just my personal feeling)
</I>&gt;<i>  * I also hope that we can see SER as a front-end (just like SEMS is
</I>&gt;<i> using SER) for more AS-type solutions. I know that a company has
</I>&gt;<i> created a (commercial) JSLEEish SER module. Personally, I believe
</I>&gt;<i> extending SER application interface is important. The upcoming SER
</I>&gt;<i> user group meeting in Prague will probably see a presentation of work
</I>&gt;<i> in progress on this

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Andrey,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, let me make some things clear. The best way to integrate an AS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into Open IMS Core (or any other IMS network) is to make use of the ISC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface and not by changing the scscf.cfg. You can define in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user's service profile on the HSS different filters and on match, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initial request will be forwarded to the indicated application servers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The scscf.cfg should not be changed except for operator specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> settings (some things are optional, customizable, etc). We did modify it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slightly for example to route to PSTN as this something usually common
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for all users, but Shared IFC is on the roadmap and will be there to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am saying the things above, just to rule out misunderstandings. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guess that you did not mean that, but I just want to be sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then, regarding the use of SER as an application server (or SER+cdp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> module, if you'd like to call it OpenIMS). Recently I have questioned
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the targeted usage of SER on the development list there. One relevant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conclusion stands out: SER is a SIP proxy and should no be abused as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AS. Now I know that this is contradictory with what happens actually in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SER, as there are application server modules in the main tree  (e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presence application server), but this is the position of the core
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developers there. So considered yourself warned ;-) and prepare yourself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be disappointed if you want to do barring with a B2BUA by using SER.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you have lots of programming resources, you can do it, no pb.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, SER does have great performance and flexibility, so a simple AS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be very easy to hack in. The CDP module offers you support for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Diameter but you still need a module/functionality for the Sh interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the HSS if you want that. I was thinking about it, but so far
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nobody was interested. If we get some more interest here, we could put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it on the road-map.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am not sure that I was clear enough, but I am very interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continuing this thread.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone tried to implement or implemented AS's of any kind on OpenIMS?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For instance, Call Barring AS. As I understand (and, please, correct
